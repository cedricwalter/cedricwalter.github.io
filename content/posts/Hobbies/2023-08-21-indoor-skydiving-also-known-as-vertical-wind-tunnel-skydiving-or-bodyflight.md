Indoor skydiving, also known as vertical wind tunnel skydiving or bodyflight, offers several advantages compared to traditional outdoor skydiving.

You can experience it all at [_Windwerk_.ch][1] in Winterthur. Whether you are a complete beginner or a pro! Wonderful experience. With Professional and dedicated team of instructors! Great experience and amazingly kind staff! This is one of those things, one should definitely have done at least once in their lifetime.

Some of the key advantages include:

## Accessibility

Indoor skydiving facilities are usually located in urban areas and are easily accessible to a wider range of people. This eliminates the need to travel to remote drop zones for outdoor skydiving.

## Weather Independence

One of the biggest advantages of indoor skydiving is that it is not affected by weather conditions. Outdoor skydiving can be cancelled or delayed due to factors like rain, wind, or low visibility. Indoor facilities are climate-controlled, ensuring consistent conditions year-round.

## Safety

While both indoor and outdoor skydiving are generally safe when practiced with proper training and equipment, indoor skydiving is considered to be a safer option for beginners. There 's no risk of parachute malfunctions, freefall accidents, or other outdoor hazards.

## Training Environment

Indoor skydiving facilities provide a controlled environment for training. Beginners can practice body positioning, stability, and basic maneuvers without the added stress of jumping from an aircraft. This makes it an ideal way to learn and improve skydiving skills.

## Cost

While indoor skydiving might seem expensive upfront, it can be more cost-effective in the long run for those who are interested in skydiving as a recreational activity. You eliminate the costs associated with airplane rides and parachutes, making it more affordable for frequent practice.

## Time Efficiency

In an indoor skydiving facility, you can get more "airtime" in a shorter period compared to traditional outdoor skydiving. There 's no need to wait for airplanes to take off, and you can have multiple sessions in a single visit.

## Family-Friendly

Indoor skydiving is often suitable for people of various ages, including children. Many facilities have age and health restrictions, but the controlled environment and absence of the fear factor associated with jumping from an airplane can make it more appealing to families.

## Entertainment and Spectator Value

Indoor skydiving facilities can be entertaining for both participants and spectators. Friends and family can watch from observation areas, creating an engaging and unique experience.

## Experimentation and Creativity

The controlled environment of indoor skydiving allows for experimentation and creativity in terms of body movements, positions, and tricks. This can be appealing to those interested in exploring the artistic and acrobatic aspects of bodyflight.

## Physical Fitness and Body Control

Indoor skydiving requires participants to use their entire body to maintain stability and control. This can contribute to improved physical fitness, body awareness, and coordination.

## Compare to real skydiving

While indoor skydiving offers numerous advantages, it 's important to note that some individuals might prefer the adrenaline rush and natural outdoor environment of traditional skydiving. Both options have their unique appeal, and the choice ultimately depends on personal preferences and goals.

| Aspect                | Indoor Skydiving | Outdoor Skydiving |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Preparation Time      | 15-30 minutes    | 1-2 hours         |
| Briefing/Instruction  | 15-30 minutes    | 30-60 minutes     |
| Flight Time           | 1-3 minutes      | 5-8 minutes       |
| Total Experience Time | 30-60 minutes    | 1.5-3 hours       |

Please note that the times provided are approximate and can vary based on factors such as the facility 's protocols, the type of skydiving experience (tandem, solo, etc.), the number of participants, and the weather conditions for outdoor skydiving. Additionally, the flight time for indoor skydiving can be divided into multiple shorter sessions if you purchase a package that includes multiple flights. For outdoor skydiving, the total time includes travel to the drop zone, gearing up, and waiting for your turn to jump.
