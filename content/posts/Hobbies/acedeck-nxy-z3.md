The AceDeck Nyx Z3 is a high-performance off-road electric skateboard designed for enthusiasts seeking power and durability for rough terrains. It's equipped with advanced features like a gear drive system for optimal torque and control, shock-absorbing channel trucks for smoother rides on uneven surfaces, and all-terrain wheels that can handle dirt, gravel, and grass with ease. The Nyx Z3 also boasts a powerful electronic speed controller (ESC), allowing it to tackle steep inclines and reach a top speed of around 37 mph.

Prices for the Nyx Z3 vary depending on the model and battery, starting from about $1,500 and going up to $2,900 for the higher-end versions

## Remote control
There are 27 options. Options 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9 cannot be adjusted or modified without authorization.
Here is the full options list as they are displayed, with their choices in operation.

1. SPEED MODE (Duty, Speed) 
2. MOTOR RUN MODE (Hybrid, Full sense) 
3. MAX SPEED (speed limiter) 
4. BATT OUT MAX (charge limiter?) 
5. BATT CELLS (is this to be set to the type of cells that are on the board?) 
6. BATT TYPE (21700, LI-POL) 
7. DRIVER FREQ (0-5) 
8. MAX BRAKE (Braking power) 
9. MOTOR RUN DIR (CCW, CW) 
10. -> 25. Control mode settings
    L, E, S, S+ MODE REF (set by percentages) 
    L, E, S, S+ MODE CUR (set by percentages) 
    L, E, S, S+ SPEEDUP LINE (set by percentages) 
    L, E, S, S+ BRAKE LINE (set by percentages) 
10. RESTORE PARA (yes, no) 
11. BLE UNBIND (yes,no)

A quick tutorial on remote control mode settings.
There are 4 modes (Low, Eco, Sport, Sport+), each of which can be completely modified and customized.
To access them, press the setup button 8 times (under the remote control's power button), then adjust them using the remote control's thumbwheel.)

For each mode, there are 4 setting options, which I detail here:
* REF MODE: As a percentage of the VMAX the skateboard can reach. 50% = approx. 30km/h You can even have a pedestrian mode by setting to 10-15% in LOW mode for example)
* CUR MODE: Amperage sent to the motors. At 100%, the amperage is maximum (120A on my model) In sport+ mode, the remote control is set to this amperage
* SPEEDUP line: Acceleration curve to Vmax: at 100%, the skate gives a very abrupt, almost brutal curve. Setting it to 50% gives a more progressive acceleration. But will not ultimately change the mode's vmax.
* BRAKE LINE: same as for the acceleration curve, here it's the braking curve: at 100%, braking power is maximum, with little progressiveness. Don't hesitate to soften the curve by lowering the percentage.

Remember to confirm by switching off the remote control! 

## Recommended helmet
### NTA-8776 E-bike rating ONLY!

This is important to look for when picking a helmet as it is rated up to 28mph. This is a new-ish rating, helmets with it have only been around past few years. Most helmets do NOT have this rating. Most helmets only have a bike helmet rating of CPSC or EN 1078 which are not rated to go much faster than 12 mph. A lot of fancy looking full face helmet only have that basic bike helmet rating, which means if you hit something hard going 20 mph it could crack right off your head and do nothing.

Even worse, it is only the AS/NZS 2063 and ASTM 1952-15 downhill ratings which have any standards front face protection. Which means full face helmets without those ratings, but only CPSC or EN1078 basic bike helmet ratings, have no standard met on the face protection. It could just be a piece of useless plastic to make it look more expensive for all you know. 

NTA-8776 E-bike rating is the thing to look for. They are tested for impact up to 28mph it was meant for escooter, ebike, esk8 riders that generally go around 20mph to 30mph.

Here's a comparison between the **ASTM F1952** and **NTA 8776** standards, specifically detailing their requirements and differences:

| Feature                             | ASTM F1952                                       | NTA 8776                                     |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Intended Use**                    | Primarily for **downhill mountain biking**       | Designed for **e-bikes, e-scooters, e-skates** up to 28 mph (45 km/h) |
| **Impact Speed Tested**             | Higher impact resistance for **downhill biking** speeds | Tested for high-speed e-mobility (45 km/h), suitable for e-bikes and e-skates |
| **Coverage**                        | Provides **full head coverage**, especially in full-face helmets | Offers **extended coverage** at the back of the head, more than typical bicycle helmets |
| **Testing Standards**               | ASTM F1952 sets **higher energy impact thresholds** for rigorous conditions | Focuses on **multi-impact protection** and **side impact resistance** |
| **Helmet Weight**                   | Typically **heavier** due to increased padding and chin guards | **Lightweight** to balance protection and comfort for e-mobility riders |
| **Ventilation**                     | Often less ventilation to enhance impact absorption | More **ventilation** to prevent overheating during longer rides |
| **Certification Label**             | Marked as ASTM F1952-certified                   | Marked as NTA 8776-certified                 |
| **Popular Brands**                  | TSG Pass, Fox Rampage Pro                        | Lazer Anverz, Abus Pedelec 2.0              |

In summary, **ASTM F1952** is ideal for high-impact sports like downhill biking, where speed and extreme conditions are a factor, while **NTA 8776** is optimized for high-speed electric mobility with a focus on lighter weight, ventilation, and coverage appropriate for urban and commuter use.

# Pros & Cons Samsung 50s, 50e, 50g
There are multiple battery configurations, with ranges from 24 to 59 miles, depending on the model (battery capacities from 653Wh to 1554Wh). 

Here's a comparison table for the lithium-ion cells often used in electric skateboards, e-bikes, and other high-drain applications.
Each type has different performance characteristics that make it suitable for various uses.

**Summary:**
- **Samsung 50S** is ideal for applications needing high capacity and decent discharge, like high-performance electric skateboards or e-bikes.
- **Samsung 50E** and **50G** offer balanced capacity and discharge current, making them good for general use in moderate power applications.
- **Other cells** like the LG MJ1 or Panasonic NCR18650GA provide alternatives but typically have lower discharge rates, which may limit them in high-power setups.

# Pros & Cons Direct Drive
| Type | Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|Direct Drive	|Quieter + less maintenance + no belt-adjustment/maintenance + easier to roll-carry	| Slightly less torque/brake power + not possible to put AT wheels |
|Belt Drive	|More customizable to improve torque/top-speed + slightly better overall torque/brakes | Difificult to roll-carry + belt breaks can be hazardous AF (very rare but worth mentioning) + loud |


# Troubleshooting
## My boards arrow show forward, but the board goes in reverse, when the arrow is in reverse, board goes forward
Open the advanced menu on your remote (8 taps of the function button), and go to settings number 9. 
Switch to CCW or CW depending on what you are on by default, and save by clicking the power button.
