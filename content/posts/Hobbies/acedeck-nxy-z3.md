1. SPEED MODE (Duty, Speed) 
2. MOTOR RUN MODE (Hybrid, Full sense) 
3. MAX SPEED (speed limiter) 
4. BATT OUT MAX (charge limiter?) 
5. BATT CELLS (is this to be set to the type of cells that are on the board?) 
6. BATT TYPE (21700, LI-POL)

    L, E, S, S+ MODE REF (set by percentages) 
    L, E, S, S+ MODE CUR (set by percentages) 
    L, E, S, S+ SPEEDUP LINE (set by percentages) 
    L, E, S, S+ BRAKE LINE (set by percentages) 
10. RESTORE PARA (yes, no) 
11. BLE UNBIND (yes,no)

A quick tutorial on remote control mode settings.
There are 4 modes (Low, Eco, Sport, Sport+), each of which can be completely modified and customized.
To access them, press the setup button 8 times (under the remote control's power button), then adjust them using the remote control's thumbwheel.)

For each mode, there are 4 setting options, which I detail here:
* REF MODE: As a percentage of the VMAX the skateboard can reach. 50% = approx. 30km/h You can even have a pedestrian mode by setting to 10-15% in LOW mode for example)
* CUR MODE: Amperage sent to the motors. At 100%, the amperage is maximum (120A on my model) In sport+ mode, the remote control is set to this amperage
* SPEEDUP line: Acceleration curve to Vmax: at 100%, the skate gives a very abrupt, almost brutal curve. Setting it to 50% gives a more progressive acceleration. But will not ultimately change the mode's vmax.
* BRAKE LINE: same as for the acceleration curve, here it's the braking curve: at 100%, braking power is maximum, with little progressiveness. Don't hesitate to soften the curve by lowering the percentage.

Remember to confirm by switching off the remote control!

## Recommended helmet
### NTA-8776 E-bike rating ONLY!

This is important to look for when picking a helmet as it is rated up to 28mph. This is a new-ish rating, helmets with it have only been around past few years. Most helmets do NOT have this rating. Most helmets only have a bike helmet rating of CPSC or EN 1078 which are not rated to go much faster than 12 mph. A lot of fancy looking full face helmet only have that basic bike helmet rating, which means if you hit something hard going 20 mph it could crack right off your head and do nothing.

Even worse, it is only the AS/NZS 2063 and ASTM 1952-15 downhill ratings which have any standards front face protection. Which means full face helmets without those ratings, but only CPSC or EN1078 basic bike helmet ratings, have no standard met on the face protection. It could just be a piece of useless plastic to make it look more expensive for all you know. 

NTA-8776 E-bike rating is the thing to look for. They are tested for impact up to 28mph it was meant for escooter, ebike, esk8 riders that generally go around 20mph to 30mph.

Here's a comparison between the **ASTM F1952** and **NTA 8776** standards, specifically detailing their requirements and differences:

| Feature                             | ASTM F1952                                       | NTA 8776                                     |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Intended Use**                    | Primarily for **downhill mountain biking**       | Designed for **e-bikes, e-scooters, e-skates** up to 28 mph (45 km/h) |
| **Impact Speed Tested**             | Higher impact resistance for **downhill biking** speeds | Tested for high-speed e-mobility (45 km/h), suitable for e-bikes and e-skates |
| **Coverage**                        | Provides **full head coverage**, especially in full-face helmets | Offers **extended coverage** at the back of the head, more than typical bicycle helmets |
| **Testing Standards**               | ASTM F1952 sets **higher energy impact thresholds** for rigorous conditions | Focuses on **multi-impact protection** and **side impact resistance** |
| **Helmet Weight**                   | Typically **heavier** due to increased padding and chin guards | **Lightweight** to balance protection and comfort for e-mobility riders |
| **Ventilation**                     | Often less ventilation to enhance impact absorption | More **ventilation** to prevent overheating during longer rides |
| **Certification Label**             | Marked as ASTM F1952-certified                   | Marked as NTA 8776-certified                 |
| **Popular Brands**                  | TSG Pass, Fox Rampage Pro                        | Lazer Anverz, Abus Pedelec 2.0              |

In summary, **ASTM F1952** is ideal for high-impact sports like downhill biking, where speed and extreme conditions are a factor, while **NTA 8776** is optimized for high-speed electric mobility with a focus on lighter weight, ventilation, and coverage appropriate for urban and commuter use.

EN 1078    - European bike and skateboard helmet standard.
ASTM F1952 - US-American downhill-mountain bike helmet standard.
ASTM F1447 - Recreational Bicycling or Roller Skating. 
ASTM F1492 – Skateboarding and Trick Roller Skating.

- **Samsung 50S** is ideal for applications needing high capacity and decent discharge, like high-performance electric skateboards or e-bikes.
- **Samsung 50E** and **50G** offer balanced capacity and discharge current, making them good for general use in moderate power applications.
- **Other cells** like the LG MJ1 or Panasonic NCR18650GA provide alternatives but typically have lower discharge rates, which may limit them in high-power setups.

# "14S6P" battery configuration?

14S: This means 14 cells are connected in series. In a series connection, the voltages of individual cells add up, so a 14S configuration results in a higher voltage. Most lithium-ion cells have a nominal voltage of 3.7V, so a 14S battery pack would have a nominal voltage of around 51.8V (14 * 3.7V). Higher voltage generally allows the motor to spin faster, which can improve the skateboard's speed and performance.

6P: This means 6 cells are connected in parallel. In a parallel configuration, the capacity (amp hours) of individual cells adds up. More parallel cells mean greater capacity, which increases the range of the skateboard by allowing it to store more energy. For instance, if each cell has a capacity of 3000mAh, then a 6P configuration would give a total capacity of 18,000mAh (or 18Ah).

In a 14S6P configuration, you combine both series and parallel setups, resulting in a battery pack with high voltage and high capacity. This configuration matters because:

* Higher Voltage: This enables better acceleration and top speeds, making the skateboard more powerful and responsive.
* Increased Capacity: More capacity means longer range, allowing you to travel further on a single charge.
* Heat Management and Reliability: More parallel cells help distribute the load, so individual cells aren’t working as hard, which can reduce heat buildup and improve battery longevity.

# Pros & Cons Direct Drive
| Type | Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|Direct Drive	|Quieter + less maintenance + no belt-adjustment/maintenance + easier to roll-carry	| Slightly less torque/brake power + not possible to put AT wheels |
|Belt Drive	|More customizable to improve torque/top-speed + slightly better overall torque/brakes | Difificult to roll-carry + belt breaks can be hazardous AF (very rare but worth mentioning) + loud |

# Airtags
There is enough space to add an Apple Airtag in the ESC box and the battery box.

# Maintenance

## Gears: every 800km or when gear start sounding dry  
There’s no need to add grease early on, as the gears come properly lubricated. 
Excessive grease can hinder heat dissipation and affect gear performance. 
owever, if they start sounding dry or you notice that some parts of the gears aren’t coated, it’s time to add a little.

2. The hardware has been upgraded for durability, so stripping the screws is unlikely. You don’t need to retighten screws unless they feel loose; overtightening can actually cause issues.

## Tires
Running 6-inch or road tires on the Z3 is possible but it goes against the purpose of an all-terrain board.
You’ll lose some confidence on rougher terrain, especially on wet grass or dirt paths. However, if you’re exclusively on the road,
knobby tires may wear down faster. Acedeck offer a  new 9-inch upgrade kit is much better suited for versatile terrain.

## Bolts tightening
The bolts hold more securely now, so you’ll only need to check them once every few rides, maybe every 5–10. 

## Battery
Store it at room temperature when not in use, ideally at 60% charge if you won’t be riding for a while.

# Troubleshooting
## My boards arrow show forward, but the board goes in reverse, when the arrow is in reverse, board goes forward
Open the advanced menu on your remote (8 taps of the function button), and go to settings number 9. 
Switch to CCW or CW depending on what you are on by default, and save by clicking the power button.
