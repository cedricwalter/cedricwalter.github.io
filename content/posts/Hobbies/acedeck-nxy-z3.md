The AceDeck Nyx Z3 is a high-performance off-road electric skateboard designed for enthusiasts seeking power and durability for rough terrains. It's equipped with advanced features like a gear drive system for optimal torque and control, shock-absorbing channel trucks for smoother rides on uneven surfaces, and all-terrain wheels that can handle dirt, gravel, and grass with ease. The Nyx Z3 also boasts a powerful electronic speed controller (ESC), allowing it to tackle steep inclines and reach a top speed of around 37 mph.

There are multiple battery configurations, with ranges from 24 to 59 miles, depending on the model (battery capacities from 653Wh to 1554Wh). The board is built for long-distance off-roading, offering significant ground clearance and robust construction to ensure durability in challenging environments.

Prices for the Nyx Z3 vary depending on the model and battery, starting from about $1,500 and going up to $2,900 for the higher-end versions

1. SPEED MODE (Duty, Speed) 
2. MOTOR RUN MODE (Hybrid, Full sense) 
3. MAX SPEED (speed limiter) 
4. BATT OUT MAX (charge limiter?) 
5. BATT CELLS (is this to be set to the type of cells that are on the board?) 
6. BATT TYPE (21700, LI-POL) 
7. DRIVER FREQ (0-5) 
8. MAX BRAKE (Braking power) 
9. MOTOR RUN DIR (CCW, CW) 
10. -> 25. Control mode settings

A quick tutorial on remote control mode settings.

There are 4 modes (Low, Eco, Sport, Sport+), each of which can be completely modified and customized.

To access them, press the setup button 8 times (under the remote control's power button), then adjust them using the remote control's thumbwheel.)

For each mode, there are 4 setting options, which I detail here:

* REF MODE: As a percentage of the VMAX the skateboard can reach. 50% = approx. 30km/h You can even have a pedestrian mode by setting to 10-15% in LOW mode for example)
* CUR MODE: Amperage sent to the motors. At 100%, the amperage is maximum (120A on my model) In sport+ mode, the remote control is set to this amperage, and...it's pretty cool...
* SPEEDUP line: Acceleration curve to Vmax: at 100%, the skate gives a very abrupt, almost brutal curve. Setting it to 50% gives a more progressive acceleration. But will not ultimately change the mode's vmax.
* BRAKE LINE: same as for the acceleration curve, here it's the braking curve: at 100%, braking power is maximum, with little progressiveness. Don't hesitate to soften the curve by lowering the percentage.

Remember to confirm by switching off the remote control!
