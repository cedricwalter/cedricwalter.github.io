I did ride a Ducati Diavel V4 300km in a hot weather 31°C and in the Hills 23°C. I did not like it at all in the city with frequent stop and go. It nearly burn my balls. Seing the temperature of the water colling reaching 118°C make me question the overall design of the bike. Its seems that going to Neutral switch off 2 cylinders, my mistake as I stayed in gear 1 while stopping. I was ready to buy a Diavel but after trying one, the motor heat is just ridiculous. I will try again one later, the V4S

The Ducati Diavel V4, while a highly praised motorcycle for its performance and unique design, does have some drawbacks that potential buyers should consider, trying one is a must.
{{< /notice >}}

# High Price and resale value
The Ducati Diavel V4 is a premium motorcycle with a correspondingly high price tag. This may put it out of reach for many potential buyers or make it hard to justify compared to other bikes with similar performance but lower costs. The Diavel V4 has a bit to much plastic everywhere for the price.

While Ducati motorcycles generally hold their value well, the niche nature of the Diavel might make it harder to find a buyer if you decide to sell it. The market for high-end power cruisers is smaller compared to more mainstream motorcycles.

## Fuel Economy
The V4 engine is powerful and delivers exhilarating performance, but this comes at the cost of fuel efficiency. The Diavel V4 might require more frequent refueling, especially during spirited riding.

## Weight
While the Diavel V4 has been engineered to handle well for its size, it is still a relatively heavy motorcycle. This can make it less agile and harder to maneuver at low speeds compared to lighter bikes.

# The Desmodromic (Desmo) valve system
Ducati motorcycles are known for their high maintenance costs. The V4 engine is complex, and servicing it can be expensive. Additionally, Ducati's parts and labor costs tend to be on the higher side.

The Desmodromic (Desmo) valve system, a signature feature of Ducati motorcycles, including those with the V4 engine, is a significant factor in the high maintenance costs associated with these bikes. Here’s why:
The Desmodromic system uses separate cam lobes and followers to open and close the valves mechanically, rather than relying on valve springs to close the valves as in most conventional engines. This system ensures precise valve timing and allows for higher RPMs, but it also adds complexity to the engine design

The Desmo system has more moving parts than traditional valve systems, including multiple cam lobes, followers, and rockers. These components require meticulous adjustment to ensure proper operation, adding time and expertise to maintenance tasks.

The Desmo valves need precise clearance adjustments to maintain optimal performance. This process, known as valve clearance checking and adjustment, is labor-intensive because it requires removing the engine’s top end, accurately measuring the clearances, and making adjustments if necessary with specialized tools.

Accessing the valves for adjustment usually involves significant disassembly, including removing the fuel tank, fairings, and sometimes even the engine from the frame, depending on the model. This makes the process more labor-intensive and time-consuming. The precision and complexity of the Desmo system mean that this work needs to be performed by highly skilled technicians who are familiar with Ducati engines. The cost of labor is higher because it requires technicians with specialized training.

While the Desmo system is known for its performance benefits, the lack of valve springs means that the components are subject to different wear patterns. Regular replacement of parts like shims or followers is sometimes necessary to maintain performance, contributing to the overall cost.

##Ducati motorcycles typically have shorter service intervals for valve adjustments compared to other bikes with conventional valvetrains. Depending on the model and how it’s ridden, valve checks might be required as frequently as every 15,000 to 18,000 miles (24,000 to 30,000 kilometers), which means more frequent and costly visits to the shop.

# Warranty and Dealer Requirements
To maintain the warranty on a Ducati, it’s often required that maintenance be performed by authorized Ducati service centers. These centers charge premium rates for their services, contributing to the overall expense.
Some Desmo maintenance procedures might be recommended or required to be done exclusively by Ducati dealers, which further increases the cost due to their higher labor rates compared to independent shops.


# Practicality
The Diavel V4 is more of a power cruiser or muscle bike, which limits its practicality for everyday use or commuting. It doesn't offer much in terms of storage or passenger comfort, making it less versatile than some other bikes in its class.

## Comfort on Long Rides
Although the Diavel V4 is designed to be more comfortable than a typical sportbike, its aggressive riding position can still cause discomfort on longer rides, especially for taller riders or those with back issues. The seating is OK but not great, an optional premiun seat is available.

## Firm Suspension
While the suspension setup is great for spirited riding, it can be too firm for some riders, especially on rough or uneven roads. This can lead to a less comfortable ride compared to bikes with more touring-oriented suspensions.

## Limited Wind Protection
The Diavel V4 has a minimalistic design, which includes a lack of substantial wind protection. At high speeds, the rider is more exposed to wind, which can lead to fatigue on longer rides, especially on highways. The absence of a full fairing or larger windshield can make high-speed cruising less comfortable. You can get one as option, small or big windshield.

## Storage Limitations
The Diavel V4, being a power cruiser with a focus on style and performance, offers very limited storage options. This can be inconvenient for riders who need to carry gear, especially on longer trips. The lack of built-in storage space or easy luggage mounting points can be a downside for touring purposes.

## Passenger Comfort
While the Diavel V4 does have a passenger seat, it’s not particularly spacious or comfortable for a second rider. The seating position is cramped, and the seat itself is relatively small, which can make it uncomfortable for passengers on longer journeys.

##  Handling at Low Speeds
The Diavel V4, while better than some cruisers in terms of handling, can still be challenging to maneuver at low speeds due to its weight and geometry. This can make it less practical for urban riding or for less experienced riders who may find it cumbersome in tight spaces or during parking.

# Technology Overload
While the advanced technology on the Diavel V4 is a selling point for many, some riders may find it overwhelming or unnecessary. The bike is equipped with numerous electronic aids, including multiple riding modes, traction control, and cornering ABS. For traditionalists or those who prefer a more analog riding experience, the abundance of electronic features might detract from the pure riding feel.

# Design
The bold and aggressive styling of the Diavel V4 is a matter of personal preference. I personaly love its design.

## Limited Customization Options
While Ducati offers some accessories and customization options, the Diavel V4's unique design limits the extent to which it can be modified compared to other cruisers or naked bikes. Riders looking for extensive personalization might find the Diavel's options somewhat restrictive. Starting at 28k CHF, I was able to configure it for me up to 34k CHF.

## Aggressive Styling
 While many riders love its muscular and futuristic look, others might find it too polarizing or less appealing compared to more traditional cruiser designs. I personaly loved the design but hated the heat.

# (Insane) Motor heat!!!!!
The motor heat of the Ducati Diavel V4 is another potential downside that can impact rider comfort and overall experience...

## Heat Management
The V4 engine generates a significant amount of heat, especially in slow-moving traffic or during stop-and-go situations. This heat can be uncomfortable for the rider, particularly in hot weather or when wearing lighter riding gear.

## Rider Comfort
The heat from the engine can radiate towards the rider's legs and lower body, which can cause discomfort during longer rides or in urban environments where speeds are lower, and airflow is reduced.

## Heat Dissipation
While Ducati has made efforts to manage heat with features like sophisticated cooling systems, the sheer power of the V4 engine means that heat dissipation can still be an issue, particularly when the engine is pushed hard. This can lead to the rider feeling excessive warmth, which may not be ideal for all-day riding comfort.

## Impact on Components
Prolonged exposure to high engine temperatures can potentially accelerate wear and tear on certain components, though this is generally mitigated by regular maintenance. However, the additional heat can still be a concern for long-term durability, especially in extreme conditions.

## Dirty cylinder deactivation heat management
The Ducati Diavel V4 features a cylinder deactivation system that shuts off two of the four cylinders under certain conditions to improve fuel efficiency and reduce engine heat. This system is designed to deactivate the rear bank of cylinders when the following conditions are met:

* Low Speed or Idle: The system primarily activates when the bike is at a low speed, such as in traffic, or when idling at a stop. This helps to reduce fuel consumption and lower the engine’s operating temperature when full power isn’t needed.
* Engine Temperature: The system typically engages when the engine reaches a certain operating temperature. It helps manage heat dissipation by reducing the workload on the engine when it’s not necessary to run all four cylinders.
* Throttle Position: The cylinder deactivation is triggered when the throttle is closed or at a very low position, indicating that the rider does not require full engine power at that moment.
* Cruising Conditions: At steady cruising speeds, particularly at lower RPMs, the system may also deactivate the rear cylinders to enhance fuel efficiency without compromising the riding experience.

Once the rider demands more power by opening the throttle, all four cylinders automatically reactivate to provide the full performance of the engine.

# Final words
Overall, while the Ducati Diavel V4’s engine heat is a common issue for high-performance motorcycles, it's particularly noticeable due to the powerful V4 engine. This factor should be considered if you plan to use the bike in warmer climates or in situations where you may frequently encounter stop-and-go traffic.

These negatives might not be deal-breakers for everyone, but they are worth considering, especially given the high investment involved in purchasing and maintaining a Ducati Diavel V4.
