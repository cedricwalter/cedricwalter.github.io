{{< notice tips>}}
Work in progress, will document here my tips and tricks for Microsoft flight simulator 2024 and xPlane 12.

You dont need anything to enjoy Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, you can play on a XBOX. 

These tips apply if you want to seriously make it close to the reality and want to use it as a tool, you need a personal computer, running Windows 11.

# Hardware
You need a Yoke, Rudder and flight throttle management.

## Budget hardware
### Logitech G Saitek Pro Flight Yoke System
115.- CHF
### Logitech G Saitek Pro Flight Rudder Pedals
131.- CHF
### Logitech G Saitek Pro Flight Throttle Quadrant
66.- CHF

## Premium hardware
What I am using. Payed 625.- CHF used (975.- New) and can be resold later for a similar amount.

### Honeycomb Alpha
It was designed to meet the requirements of flight simulator users, but also of flight students and pilots. All internal components are manufactured in aviation quality and offer a realistic flight experience with realistic ergonomics. The high quality mechanics offer a realistic full 180° rotation angle for aileron control with a self-centering mechanism without dead zone. In longitudinal direction the steel shaft allows a range of motion of 15 cm. The mechanism is made entirely of metal for durability and the yoke features a switch panel with battery and alternator switch, avionics main switch and light switches. It is equipped with a red LED backlight so that it can be easily operated at night. There is also an ignition switch, as is common on piston engine aircraft. The left handle has two buttons, two 2-way hat switches and a push-to-talk button, while the right handle has two more 2-way hat switches, an 8-way panorama switch and a button. Thanks to a matching bracket, Alpha Flight Controls are compatible with both Honeycomb and Saitek products.
The included driver and configuration software provides individual profile settings for different aircraft and is compatible with Windows and macOS.

New arounf 260.- CHF (got it for 160.- used but like new in the box)    

### Honeycomb Bravo: 
The thrust lever quadrant allows configurations from the single-engine small aircraft to the four-engine airliner. 

It supports various cockpit systems such as autopilot, annunciator panel, landing gear switch, flaps and trim. 

The thrust levers can be configured for single and multi-engine small aircraft with separate flap switch. 

For use in an airliner, a configuration with two or four thrust levers, levers for spoilers and flaps can be selected. Here the thrust reverser can also be operated. The autopilot panel includes the most common functions used in commercial and GA aircraft. The Annunciator Panel with 14 indicator lights displays the most important status and warning messages of the on-board systems. Additional functions are provided by the landing gear switch, the trim wheel and 7 freely programmable switches, so that the user does not have to use the keyboard so often.

New arounf 265.- CHF (got it for 160.- used but like new in the box)

### Thrustmaster Rudder TPR

All set for immediate liftoff: With the first rudder with a S.M.A.R.T-guide rail system (Sliding Motion on Aluminium Rail Tracks) for smooth control. System of 4 industrial aluminium slide rails for a perfect sliding movement. Two differential brake pedals: Large differential brake pedals: 25 centimeters (equivalent to shoe size 45). USB and/or proprietary RJ12 connectivity: On PC (Windows 10/8/7/Vista), works with all standard joysticks.

On PC and on PS4, works and connects directly to the Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas 4 joystick. Advanced calibration software for setting dead zones: Set the central dead zone. T.A.R.G.E.T Advanced PC Programming Software: Allows you to program the axes and differential brakes.

Two differential brake pedals for optimized flying! - Large differential brake pedals: 25 centimeters (shoe size 12/45). Rounded central pivot point with central grip on the differential brake axles. Pivot point with a 15° range of motion: On an incline for intentional operation, avoiding unintentional activation when using the rudder.

Stable and precise - Versatile ergonomic design, suitable for all types of flights (aerial combat, space adventure, civil flight, etc.): Removed heel support = rudder control with the ball of the foot. Mounted heel support = one hundred percent support of the foot on the pedal.

New arounf 450.- CHF (got it for 300.- used)

# Stream Deck XL or +
There is a lot of free and paid extension for the Stream Deck at https://flightsim.to/others/stream-deck/1

If youre on a budget you can also use a cheap tablet and Touch Portal (Android/iOS)

# If you have an Ipad
Reusing an iPad/Android device is easy. The Samsung Galaxy A9+ 11inch is cheap at 140.- CHF

Print either one of these mount
* https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4554130 for iPad Air or any 11 inches tablet
* https://makerworld.com/en/models/33439 for any iPad/tablet


Install Air Manager on iPad (22€ iOS, 23 CHF Android) and connect XPlane or Microsoft Simulator 2024

# Computer Software
You need:
* Somehow a powerful computer, recommended is AMD AM5 7800X3D, Radeon 7900 XTX or Nvidia Geforce RTX 4080
* Windows 11
* Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and or Xplane 12

Nice to Have:
* Air manager v4 (https://www.siminnovations.com/shop/air-manager-desktop/) let you simulate any panel on a touch screen monitor (USB) or iPad so you can avoid buying costly MFD.
* The knobster can be build on your own but costs are really close to price asked...
