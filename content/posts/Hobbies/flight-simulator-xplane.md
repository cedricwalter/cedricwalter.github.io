{{< notice tips>}}
Work in progress, will document here my tips and tricks for Microsoft flight simulator 2024 and xPlane 12. 

Computer simulation is cheap or can be expensive, but it is a tool. If you are ready to do your PPL or PPL(H), money should not be an issue.

You dont need anything to enjoy Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, you can play on a XBOX. 

These tips apply if you want to seriously make it close to the reality and want to use it as a tool, you need a personal computer, running Windows 11.

# Hardware
You need a Yoke, Rudder and flight throttle management.

## Budget hardware

131.- CHF
### Logitech G Saitek Pro Flight Throttle Quadrant
66.- CHF

## Premium hardware
What I am using. Payed 625.- CHF used (975.- New) and can be resold later for a similar amount.

### Honeycomb Alpha
It was designed to meet the requirements of flight simulator users, but also of flight students and pilots. All internal components are manufactured in aviation quality and offer a realistic flight experience with realistic ergonomics. The high quality mechanics offer a realistic full 180° rotation angle for aileron control with a self-centering mechanism without dead zone. In longitudinal direction the steel shaft allows a range of motion of 15 cm. The mechanism is made entirely of metal for durability and the yoke features a switch panel with battery and alternator switch, avionics main switch and light switches. It is equipped with a red LED backlight so that it can be easily operated at night. There is also an ignition switch, as is common on piston engine aircraft. The left handle has two buttons, two 2-way hat switches and a push-to-talk button, while the right handle has two more 2-way hat switches, an 8-way panorama switch and a button. Thanks to a matching bracket, Alpha Flight Controls are compatible with both Honeycomb and Saitek products.
The included driver and configuration software provides individual profile settings for different aircraft and is compatible with Windows and macOS.

New arounf 260.- CHF (got it for 160.- used but like new in the box)    

iPad/Android device mount for the honeycomb
* https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4554130 for iPad Air or any 11 inches tablet
* https://makerworld.com/en/models/33439 for any iPad/tablet

### Honeycomb Bravo: 
The thrust lever quadrant allows configurations from the single-engine small aircraft to the four-engine airliner. 

It supports various cockpit systems such as autopilot, annunciator panel, landing gear switch, flaps and trim. 

The thrust levers can be configured for single and multi-engine small aircraft with separate flap switch. 

For use in an airliner, a configuration with two or four thrust levers, levers for spoilers and flaps can be selected. Here the thrust reverser can also be operated. The autopilot panel includes the most common functions used in commercial and GA aircraft. The Annunciator Panel with 14 indicator lights displays the most important status and warning messages of the on-board systems. Additional functions are provided by the landing gear switch, the trim wheel and 7 freely programmable switches, so that the user does not have to use the keyboard so often.

New arounf 265.- CHF (got it for 160.- used but like new in the box)

### Thrustmaster Rudder TPR

All set for immediate liftoff: With the first rudder with a S.M.A.R.T-guide rail system (Sliding Motion on Aluminium Rail Tracks) for smooth control. System of 4 industrial aluminium slide rails for a perfect sliding movement. Two differential brake pedals: Large differential brake pedals: 25 centimeters (equivalent to shoe size 45). USB and/or proprietary RJ12 connectivity: On PC (Windows 10/8/7/Vista), works with all standard joysticks.

On PC and on PS4, works and connects directly to the Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas 4 joystick. Advanced calibration software for setting dead zones: Set the central dead zone. T.A.R.G.E.T Advanced PC Programming Software: Allows you to program the axes and differential brakes.

Two differential brake pedals for optimized flying! - Large differential brake pedals: 25 centimeters (shoe size 12/45). Rounded central pivot point with central grip on the differential brake axles. Pivot point with a 15° range of motion: On an incline for intentional operation, avoiding unintentional activation when using the rudder.

Stable and precise - Versatile ergonomic design, suitable for all types of flights (aerial combat, space adventure, civil flight, etc.): Removed heel support = rudder control with the ball of the foot. Mounted heel support = one hundred percent support of the foot on the pedal.

New arounf 450.- CHF (got it for 300.- used)

## Stream Deck XL or + (optional)
Allow you to win time by creating shortcuts for preflight, flight.
There is a lot of free and paid extension for the Stream Deck at https://flightsim.to/others/stream-deck/1

If youre on a budget you can also use a cheap tablet and Touch Portal (Android/iOS)
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rils.apps.touchportal&hl=en 

## Logitech Flight panels
Saitek has been bought by Logitech, and they have nice panels:

* [Switch panel](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ch/products/flight/flight-simulator-switch-panel.html)
* [Radio panel](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ch/products/flight/flight-simulator-cockpit-radio-panel.html)
* [Multi panel](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ch/products/flight/flight-simulator-autopilot-multipanel.html)

You can find them used everywhere. The Honeycomb yoke provide already (Switch) and (Multi), the radio panel is a "nice to have".

In Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, you MUST manualy start the Logitech Plugin.
It’s noch automatically initialising with the start of MSFS 2024.
Install the driver https://download01.logi.com/web/ftp/pub/techsupport/simulation/MSFS_Plugin_x64_Software_8.0.313.0.exe and run the exe before starting flight simulator 2024.
So, if you have the plug-in installed, create a shortcut on the desktop with this adress and the start arguments at the end:
 “C:\Program Files\Logitech\Microsoft Flight Simulator Plugin\LogiMicrosoftFlightSimulator.exe” --run --force

The Logitech driver has not been updated for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 yet, and is limited. There is a project Spad.next that let you customize all buttons and switches, work great but require a one time payment.

# Computer Software
You need:
* Somehow a powerful computer, recommended is AMD AM5 7800X3D, Radeon 7900 XTX or Nvidia Geforce RTX 4080
* Windows 11
* Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and or Xplane 12

# Simulator enviroment dilemna
You can go cheap or crazy expensive really fast.

## Use real MFD
Going with physical and expensive hardware MFD!

{{< notice tips>}}
Multifunction display (MFD): Small screen (CRT or LCD) in an aircraft that can be used to display information to the pilot in numerous configurable ways. Often an MFD will be used in concert with a primary flight display.
{{< /notice >}}

Some MFD examples:

* https://flightsimdiy.com 500.- and up
* https://www.realsimgear.com  up to 2500.-
* Thrustmaster MFD panel
* [Logitech MFD panel](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ch/products/flight/flight-simulator-instrument-panel.html), try to grab them second hand!
  (110.- to 170.-) 
* DIY from thingiverse, e.g. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5738740
* MFD can also be build, a raspberry pi, a 3D printed enclosure and linux air player 


Recommended is to use a touch panel or monitor and buy Air manager v4 (https://www.siminnovations.com/shop/air-manager-desktop/) to you simulate any panel on a touch screen monitor (USB) or iPad so you can avoid buying costly MFD.

Install Air Manager on iPad (22€ iOS, 23 CHF Android) and connect XPlane or Microsoft Simulator 2024

Nice to Have:
* The knobster can be build on your own but costs are really close to price asked...

## Touch display With HDMI
you may need a lot of HDMI cable and support (commercial MFD use USB port instead).

You need to use [Pop Out Panel Manager (Free)](https://flightsim.to/file/35759/msfs-pop-out-panel-manager) or Air Manager V4 

## Touch display with tablet
Use either 
* Air Manager v4
* [simionic ](https://www.simionic.net/wordpress/g1000-apps/) but may be outdated

## Mixed Reality
The most immersive!
You can use a free tool to define what will be rendered by the simulator and what not: you keep your physical panels visible!

You need
- Meta Quest 3
- OpenKneeBoard (Free)   [OpenKneeboard](https://openkneeboard.com)
