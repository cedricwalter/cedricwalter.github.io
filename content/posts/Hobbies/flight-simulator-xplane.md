## Stream Deck XL or + (optional)
Allow you to win time by creating shortcuts for preflight, flight.
There is a lot of free and paid extension for the Stream Deck at https://flightsim.to/others/stream-deck/1

If youre on a budget you can also use a cheap tablet and Touch Portal (Android/iOS)
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rils.apps.touchportal&hl=en 

## Logitech Flight panels
Saitek has been bought by Logitech, and they have nice panels.

### Logitech Flight Switch Panel

* [Switch panel](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ch/products/flight/flight-simulator-switch-panel.html)

You don't need the Logitech Flight Switch Panel if you already have the Honeycomb Alpha (yoke) and Bravo (throttle quadrant). Here's why:
* The Honeycomb Alpha already has a master battery, alternator, avionics, and light switches, covering most of what the Logitech panel offers.
* The Honeycomb Bravo includes a landing gear lever with LED indicators, which is one of the key features of the Logitech panel.
* The Logitech panel primarily adds additional switches for lights, fuel pump, de-icing, and magneto selection, but you can easily map those to the Bravo or Alpha.
Unless you really want dedicated physical switches for every function.

---

### Logitech Flight Multi Panel

* [Multi panel](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ch/products/flight/flight-simulator-autopilot-multipanel.html)

you don’t need the Logitech Flight Multi Panel if you already have the Honeycomb Alpha (yoke) and Bravo (throttle quadrant). The Bravo Throttle Quadrant already includes an autopilot panel with knobs and buttons for altitude, heading, vertical speed, and other essential autopilot functions. This effectively makes the Logitech panel redundant.
However, if you want additional LCD readouts for autopilot settings or prefer the Logitech layout, you could still use it, but it’s not necessary.

---

### Logitech Flight Radio Panel

* [Radio panel](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ch/products/flight/flight-simulator-cockpit-radio-panel.html)

#### What the Logitech Flight Radio Panel Adds:
- **Dedicated radio tuning (COM, NAV, ADF, XPDR)**
- **Quick frequency changes** without needing to use mouse/keyboard.
- **More realism** if you frequently interact with radios (e.g., VATSIM, IFR flights).

#### Do You Need It?
- If you **mostly fly VFR**, the Bravo's dials and buttons can handle COM/NAV switching just fine.
- If you **fly IFR often**, having a separate radio stack can **improve immersion and efficiency**.
- If you **use VR a lot**, physical radio controls can make tuning easier without relying on VR controllers.

---

#### Alternative?
- **Use an on-screen radio stack** (in-sim pop-ups).
- **Map radio controls to Bravo’s knobs and switches** (less intuitive but works).
- **Consider an iPad with Air Manager** for a touchscreen radio stack.

If you like having **dedicated, easy-to-use radio controls**, then the Logitech panel is a good add-on. Otherwise, the Bravo can handle most of it with some extra mappings.

#### Two Logitech Flight Radio Panel better than one?
Some people use **two** Logitech Flight Radio Panels to increase efficiency and realism, especially for **IFR flying**. Here’s why:  

##### **1. Quick Access to Multiple Frequencies**  
Each Logitech Flight Radio Panel has **two frequency displays** (active & standby), and you can toggle between:  
- COM1 / COM2 (for ATC communications)  
- NAV1 / NAV2 (for VOR/ILS navigation)  
- ADF (for NDB navigation)  
- XPDR (for squawk codes)  

With **one** panel, you have to switch modes frequently. With **two**, you can dedicate:  
- One for **COM1 & COM2** (handling ATC comms without switching modes).  
- One for **NAV1 & NAV2 or ADF & XPDR** (for quick navigation adjustments).  

##### **2. More Realistic Setup**  
In real aircraft, radios are usually separate units in the stack. Two panels allow:  
- **Permanent COM & NAV displays**, making tuning easier.  
- **Faster frequency changes** without switching modes mid-flight.  

##### **3. IFR & VATSIM Flying**  
Pilots who fly IFR (especially on **VATSIM or IVAO**) need to change frequencies **constantly**. With two panels:  
- One panel can handle **ATC frequencies (COM1/COM2)**.  
- The other can handle **NAV aids & squawk codes**.  

This makes operations **faster, smoother, and more immersive**.  

##### **4. Convenience in VR**  
If you're flying in **VR**, using two panels means **less button switching** and more intuitive frequency management, so you don’t have to fiddle with menus or controllers.  

##### **Do You Need Two?**  
- If you fly **casual VFR**, one panel (or even just the Bravo) is enough.  
- If you fly **serious IFR, especially online**, two panels can **greatly** improve workflow.  
- If you prefer **max realism**, a dual-panel setup mimics real aircraft radio stacks.  

You can find them used everywhere. The Honeycomb yoke provide already (Switch) and (Multi), the radio panel is a "nice to have".

#### Drivers
In Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, you MUST manualy start the Logitech Plugin.
It’s noch automatically initialising with the start of MSFS 2024.
Install the driver https://download01.logi.com/web/ftp/pub/techsupport/simulation/MSFS_Plugin_x64_Software_8.0.313.0.exe and run the exe before starting flight simulator 2024.
So, if you have the plug-in installed, create a shortcut on the desktop with this adress and the start arguments at the end:
 “C:\Program Files\Logitech\Microsoft Flight Simulator Plugin\LogiMicrosoftFlightSimulator.exe” --run --force

The Logitech driver has not been updated for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 yet, and is limited. There is a project Spad.next that let you customize all buttons and switches, work great but require a one time payment.

## Screen estate
Simulator enviroment dilemna... You can go cheap or crazy expensive really fast.

| Choice   |      Note |
|----------|:------:|
| Use Real MFD, PFD   |  Expensive as hell, not flexible but close to real feeling, with real knob and buttons |
| Touch display With HDMI |  LCD screens with touch are not cheap |
| Touch display with Android | cheap and you have a real tablet fto use when not flying! I use Lenovo M11 |
| LCD display using HDMI to desktop | cheap, require a free extension in MSFS |
| LCD display, Linux, PI | cheap, DIY with linux and air player and air manager on your desktop, custom 3d printed case |

---

### Use real MFD
Going with physical and expensive hardware MFD!

{{< notice tips>}}
Multifunction display (MFD): Small screen (CRT or LCD) in an aircraft that can be used to display information to the pilot in numerous configurable ways. Often an MFD will be used in concert with a PFD (primary flight display).
{{< /notice >}}

Some MFD examples:

* https://flightsimdiy.com 500.- and up
* https://www.realsimgear.com  up to 2500.-
* Thrustmaster MFD panel
* [Logitech MFD panel](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ch/products/flight/flight-simulator-instrument-panel.html), try to grab them second hand!
  (110.- to 170.-) 
* DIY from thingiverse, e.g. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5738740
* MFD can also be build, a raspberry pi, a 3D printed enclosure and linux air player 

Recommended is to use a touch panel or monitor and buy Air manager v4 (https://www.siminnovations.com/shop/air-manager-desktop/) to you simulate any panel on a touch screen monitor (USB) or iPad so you can avoid buying costly MFD.

Install Air Manager on iPad (22€ iOS, 23 CHF Android) and connect XPlane or Microsoft Simulator 2024

#### Glas cockpit
A **glass cockpit** is a modern aircraft cockpit that replaces traditional analog gauges and dials with electronic displays, typically LCD or LED screens. These displays show flight information such as altitude, airspeed, heading, and navigation data. The **Garmin G1000** is one of the most popular glass cockpit systems, widely used in general aviation, training aircraft, and some business jets.

##### Key Components of a Glass Cockpit with Garmin G1000:

1. **Primary Flight Display (PFD):**  
   The PFD provides essential flight information, including:  
   - Attitude Indicator (pitch and roll)  
   - Airspeed Indicator  
   - Altimeter  
   - Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)  
   - Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI), showing navigation and heading  
   - Flight Director cues  

2. **Multi-Function Display (MFD):**  
   The MFD complements the PFD by displaying additional data:  
   - Moving map with GPS navigation  
   - Engine parameters  
   - Weather radar (if equipped)  
   - Traffic information (with ADS-B or TCAS systems)  
   - Checklist and system diagnostics  

3. **Integrated Avionics Suite:**  
   The G1000 integrates various systems, such as:  
   - GPS navigation  
   - Autopilot  
   - Traffic and weather data integration  
   - Radio communication (VHF)  

### Advantages of a Glass Cockpit with G1000:
- **Improved Situational Awareness:** The PFD and MFD provide a clear and intuitive overview of flight data.  
- **Reduced Workload:** Features like a flight director and autopilot simplify complex tasks.  
- **Customization:** Pilots can tailor displays to show relevant information.  
- **Training Efficiency:** Standardized layouts across aircraft make transitioning between planes easier.  

##### Training tips

Using the **Garmin G1000** for flight training offers significant benefits due to its advanced features and intuitive interface. Here are some tips to maximize its potential for training:

---

###### **1. Learn the Basics Before Flying**
- **Familiarize Yourself with the G1000 Simulator**  
  Garmin offers a **G1000 PC Trainer** for practice. It allows you to explore the system on the ground, helping you learn without the pressures of flight.
  
- **Understand the Layout**  
  - **PFD (Primary Flight Display)**: Focuses on real-time flight data (attitude, airspeed, altitude, heading).  
  - **MFD (Multi-Function Display)**: Displays navigation charts, engine data, traffic, and weather.  
  - **Control Knobs & Buttons**: Get used to the dual-function knobs, softkeys, and menus.

- **Study the Pilot’s Guide**  
  Garmin provides a detailed pilot’s guide for the G1000. Spend time understanding the key features, including GPS navigation, autopilot, and emergency functions.

---

###### **2. Start with Core Skills**
- **Basic Flight Instruments**  
  Practice interpreting the PFD for attitude, airspeed, heading, and altitude. Use the HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator) to integrate navigation with situational awareness.

- **GPS Navigation**  
  - Learn to input and follow flight plans.  
  - Practice direct-to navigation.  
  - Use the map for awareness but verify with other navigation aids (VOR, ADF).

- **Flight Director and Autopilot**  
  - Understand how to enable and follow the flight director cues.  
  - Gradually introduce autopilot functions, starting with basic modes like heading (HDG) and altitude (ALT) hold.

---

###### **3. Practice Emergency Scenarios**
- **Simulate Instrument Failures**  
  - Learn how to recognize and respond to PFD or MFD failures.  
  - Use backup instruments or switch displays (e.g., using the *reversionary mode*).

- **Engine Monitoring**  
  - Use the MFD to monitor engine parameters and understand abnormal indications.  
  - Practice responding to alerts (e.g., high oil temperature or low fuel).

- **Terrain Awareness**  
  - Use the terrain map and alerts to avoid Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT).  

---

###### **4. Develop Advanced Skills**
- **IFR Training**  
  - Use the G1000 for precise IFR approaches (ILS, RNAV, and VOR).  
  - Practice loading and flying instrument approaches using the MFD for situational awareness.  

- **Traffic Awareness**  
  - If equipped with ADS-B, familiarize yourself with traffic alerts and avoidance strategies.

- **Weather Integration**  
  - Learn to interpret weather data on the MFD (if equipped with XM Weather or equivalent).  

---

###### **5. In-Flight Tips**
- **Plan Ahead**  
  Always set up your flight plan, radios, and autopilot before takeoff to minimize distractions.

- **Scan Outside**  
  Don’t get fixated on the screens. Maintain a balance between monitoring the G1000 and looking outside.

- **Slow Down When Needed**  
  If overwhelmed, ask for vectors or hold in a safe area to sort things out on the G1000.

---

###### **6. Post-Flight Review**
- **Analyze Recorded Data**  
  If your aircraft supports it, download flight data for review. Use tools like **Garmin Pilot** or **CloudAhoy** to analyze your performance.

- **Debrief with an Instructor**  
  Discuss what went well and what could be improved.

### Knobster (nice to have)
Allows you to control every wheel and button of your flight simulation software like Air Manager or Air Player Cockpit Panel,
also works in VR with knobXP for xplane or knobFS for Microsoft flight simulator

https://siminnovations.com/wiki/index.php?title=KnobFS

The knobster can be build on your own but costs are really close to price asked...

### Touch display With HDMI
you may need a lot of HDMI cable and support (commercial MFD use USB port instead).

You need to use [Pop Out Panel Manager (Free)](https://flightsim.to/file/35759/msfs-pop-out-panel-manager) or Air Manager V4 

### Touch display with tablet
Use either 
* Air Manager v4
* [simionic ](https://www.simionic.net/wordpress/g1000-apps/) but may be outdated
The most immersive!
You can use a free tool to define what will be rendered by the simulator and what not: you keep your physical panels visible!

## Motion platform (really nice to have)
{{< notice tips>}}
Motions platform deliver all six axes of movements: heave, roll, pitch, surge, sway, and yaw. it will never be able to smulate G
{{< /notice >}}

* Next Level Racing motion v3 3600.- 25kg what i'm using
* Qubic System QS-S25 https://qubicsystem.com/product/qs-s25/  30k CHF 460kg!
* DoF Reality P6 Pro https://dofreality.com/product/racing/motion-racing-rig-6-axis-pro-p6/   8000.- CHF 

## Eye tracker (really nice to have)
You can just setup a tracker system for free with an android phone, droidcam phone app and windows app, trackAl on pc, and also openTrack. Works great.

## Buttkicker / Haptic Feedback (for enhanced immersion) - (really nice to have)

Not needed with the motion v3 platform

### Do It Yourself
You just need a cheap transducer (e.g. https://www.amazon.it/Rockwood-Bodyshaker/dp/B002LQAHPE), a cheap amplifier (e.g. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B06Y67PZB1), some cables and maybe a usb sound card. 
Plug everything together and run the 
[simshaker](https://simshaker-for-aviators.github.io/SimShaker-for-Aviators-Releases/) software
or https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/Shake-It-for-bass-shakers (Car)

https://forums.mudspike.com/t/feedback-for-flight-simulation-2020/10886

### Buttkicker
You can install the buttkicker https://thebuttkicker.com but it can cost up to 1000.- CHF

## Mixed Reality
You need
- Meta Quest 3
- [OpenKneeboard (Free)](https://openkneeboard.com) or https://flightsim.to/file/64739/color-panel-for-vr-passthrough

Quest 3 and RTX 4080 super. I have been experimenting with Virtual Desktop and Airlink.
 I can run the game at a very high resolution over 3000 pixel per eye. 200 LOD in Terrain details
  and 140 LOD in object details. Trees in Low and the rest is medium and some high and Ultra texture. 
  It runs fine and overall is sharp. I have to use ASW and DLSS Quality.
It runs smoother in Virtual Destkop BUT not as sharp.
With arilink, is the opposite. Feels not as smooth but could keep up at 36 fps with 72 Hz refresh rate.
 The color, contrast, and sharpness are better with Airlink.
My main issue with the EFB. Is only functional if your planes have the actual EFB holder. 
Even that, the texts are blurry because they are too smooth. I could barely make changes on my
 flight plan with it WHILE flying at the same time. Some planes I have to pause it and making changes to it outside of VR.

If you're flying small planes in France and want to fly patterns realistically you will know that MSFS doesn't always give you valid landing instructions.
In France every aerodrome has a VAC (Visual
Approach Chart), which is published for free and are easy to find online.
luse a mobile app usually called IVAC https://.play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.julienroze.ivac
... But there are lots of lists of them online also, eg

* AI Traffic Control: Manages AI traffic, providing instructions to both the user and AI-controlled aircraft, contributing to a dynamic and realistic airspace environment.

## Tablet
A tablet can be really handy, but I think its best use is for charts, which you can load up from a second screen's browser using [Microsoft's Xbox only official flight planner](https://planner.flightsimulator.com) or the free repository at [chartfox.org](https://chartfox.org)
