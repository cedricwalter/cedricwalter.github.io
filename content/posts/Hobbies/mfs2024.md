{{< notice warning>}}
Work in progress, will document here my tips and tricks for Microsoft flight simulator 2024. 
Computer simulation is cheap or can be expensive, but it is a tool. If you are ready to do your PPL or PPL(H), money should not be an issue.

{{< notice tips>}}
You dont need anything to enjoy Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, you can play on a XBOX. 
These tips apply if you want to seriously make it close to the reality and want to use it as a tool, you need a personal computer, running Windows 11.

### Dont buy it for now
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is looking great but really buggy and not recommended before end of 2025. The career mode is broken.

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is the next-generation installment in the Microsoft Flight Simulator series, developed by Asobo Studio and published by Microsoft. It builds on the success of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 by introducing enhanced features, new gameplay elements, and expanded realism for virtual aviation enthusiasts. Work on Windows/Xbox only.

If you're flying small planes in France and want to fly patterns realistically you will know that MSFS doesn't always give you valid landing instructions.
In France every aerodrome has a VAC (Visual
Approach Chart), which is published for free and are easy to find online.
luse a mobile app usually called IVAC https://.play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.julienroze.ivac
... But there are lots of lists of them online also, eg

## VATSIM (Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network):
A global online network for flight simulation enthusiasts.

* Allows virtual pilots and air traffic controllers (ATC) to interact in real-time.
* Pilots use flight simulation software like Microsoft Flight Simulator or X-Plane to fly while VATSIM provides a realistic ATC experience.
* Controllers on VATSIM use radar simulation software to manage air traffic.
* Real-world-like ATC communications (via voice or text).
* A large, active community with events and training opportunities.
* Free to use.

* AI Traffic Control: Manages AI traffic, providing instructions to both the user and AI-controlled aircraft, contributing to a dynamic and realistic airspace environment.

## Tablet
A tablet can be really handy, but I think its best use is for charts, which you can load up from a second screen's browser using [Microsoft's Xbox only official flight planner](https://planner.flightsimulator.com) or the free repository at [chartfox.org](https://chartfox.org)
