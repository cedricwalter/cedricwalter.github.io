Since 2 months now, I have experienced discomfort and issues related to the patella (kneecap) after a 8km running. The vastus medialis is indeed a crucial muscle in the quadriceps group that plays a significant role in stabilizing the patella and preventing issues like patellar maltracking or instability.

The vastus medialis obliquus (VMO), a specific portion of the vastus medialis, is often emphasized in exercises to help strengthen and support the patella. Strengthening this muscle can contribute to better patellar alignment and reduce the risk of injuries or discomfort associated with running, especially on hard surfaces.

I made some research and this is how i try to improve and remove the pains:

**Quad Strengthening Exercises:**
Incorporate exercises that specifically target the vastus medialis, such as leg extensions, terminal knee extensions, and squats. These exercises can help build strength in the quadriceps, including the VMO.

**Proper Running Technique:**
Ensure that your running technique is sound. Pay attention to your stride, foot placement, and overall form. Proper mechanics can reduce the impact on your joints and minimize the risk of injuries.

**Gradual Progression:**
Avoid overtraining or suddenly increasing the intensity of your runs. Gradual progression allows your muscles and joints to adapt to the demands of running, reducing the risk of overuse injuries.

**Surface Selection:**
If possible, choose softer surfaces for running, such as grass or trails, to decrease the impact on your joints. If you frequently run on harder surfaces like pavement, investing in well-cushioned running shoes may also help absorb some of the shock.

**Stretching and Warm-up:**
Prioritize a proper warm-up routine before running, including dynamic stretches for the lower body. This helps improve flexibility and prepares your muscles for the activity.

**Cross-Training:**
Incorporate cross-training activities into your fitness routine. Activities like swimming or cycling can provide cardiovascular benefits while reducing the impact on your joints.

**Consultation with a Professional:**
If you continue to experience issues, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or a physical therapist. They can assess your specific situation, provide targeted exercises, and offer personalized advice based on your individual needs.

## Strengthening the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) for knee stability

1. **Terminal Knee Extensions:**
- Sit on a chair or bench with a resistance band looped around a fixed point and the back of your knee.
- Straighten your knee against the resistance, focusing on engaging the VMO.
- Control the movement on the way back.

2. **Leg Extensions:**
- Use a leg extension machine at the gym or a resistance band attached to a sturdy anchor point.
- Lift your legs against resistance, emphasizing the contraction of the quadriceps, especially the VMO.

3. **Step-Ups:**
- Step up onto a sturdy platform or bench, focusing on pushing through the heel.
- Engage the VMO by fully extending the knee with control.

4. **Wall Sits:**
- Sit against a wall with your knees at a 90-degree angle.
- Hold the position, engaging the quadriceps, including the VMO, to maintain the seated position.

5. **Isometric VMO Contractions:**
- Sit or lie down with your legs extended.
- Place a rolled-up towel under your knee and press down, activating the VMO without knee movement.

6. **Mini Squats:**
- Perform shallow squats, focusing on keeping your knees aligned over your toes.
- The controlled movement engages the VMO throughout the squat.

7. **Prone Hamstring Curls:**
- Lie face down on a leg curl machine or use ankle weights.
- Curl your heels towards your glutes, engaging the entire posterior chain, including the VMO.

8. **Seated Leg Press:**
- Use a leg press machine with an emphasis on a narrow foot position.
- Push the platform using your heels and focusing on engaging the VMO.

9. **Lateral Step-Ups:**
- Step laterally onto a bench or platform, engaging the VMO to lift your body.
- Alternate sides to work both legs.

10. **Bulgarian Split Squats:**
- Stand with one foot forward and the other foot elevated on a bench or step.
- Lower your body into a lunge, emphasizing the work on the forward leg, particularly the VMO.

Remember to start with a weight or resistance level that allows you to maintain proper form, and gradually progress as your strength improves. If you have any existing knee issues or concerns, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or a fitness expert before starting a new exercise routine.
