Work in progress, will document here my tips and tricks for xPlane 12. 
Computer simulation is cheap or can be expensive, but it is a tool. If you are ready to do your PPL or PPL(H), money should not be an issue.

You dont need anything to enjoy X-Plane 12

### Guimbal Cabri G2 helicopter in X-Plane 12
The Guimbal Cabri G2 is a two-seat helicopter designed by Bruno Guimbal and produced by Hélicoptères Guimbal (France). The G2 initial demonstrator flew in 1992 and entered commercial service in 2008. It received type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in December 2007. In 2015 it received type certification from the FAA, and began operations in the US.

The VSKYLABS helicopters development and testing process are using the [Pro Flight Trainer Puma X](https://www.pro-flight-trainer.com/) flight controls system as the main and standard-hardware equipment for development and testing in X-Plane by LR. 
An installation and setup guide, including detailed X-Plane settings recommendations for each one of the VSKYLABS helicopters is on the making, and it will be posted in each helicopter product page as well as in the VSKYLABS Support forums.

The development of the VSKYLABS Guimbal Cabri G2 Project for X-Plane Flight Simulator was approved by Hélicoptères Guimbal. However, it is an independent VSKYLABS project which is not affiliated with and/or endorsed by Hélicoptères Guimbal.
