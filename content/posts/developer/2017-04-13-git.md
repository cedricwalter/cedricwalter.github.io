## A git workflow that is easy and scale for product development

There are numerous GIT workflow floating around
like [Centralized Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#centralized-workflow)
, [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
, [Forking flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)
and [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

Over the last 10 years, I have followed this really simple workflow, similar to the forking flow.- it allow Parallel
Development, features branches can be merged to any release branches or ideally Master

- Collaboration Feature branches also make it easier for two or more developers to collaborate on the same feature

We consider Master the stable version of the product, this branch should be deployed automatically using continuous
delivery

## Every ticket, bugs, fix, features

is done first in a new branch from master

- Using the ticket number first,
- with a short but understandable description written in lower case, e.g. PROJ-11-fix-login. This will let you create
  automatic releases notes because [Jira ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
  and [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) will recognize the ticket number in the branch name

These ticket, bugs, fix, features should NEVER be merged to master without a Pull Request (PR) and a code
review.

After the review process it can be merged to master. (merge will be blocked if no reviewer has accepted the code
changes)

## Delivering code

Code deployed to production or customer instance can ONLY be deployed from a release branch name 1.0, 1.1, 1.2,….

## Fixes in production or customer release

Fixes in production or customer release branch are done the usual way (ticket-name but branch created from release
branch name) and create a new git tag 1.0.1 (first fix of release 1.0.1, then 1.0.2 ….)

These branches created from release branches can but must NOT be merged to master depending on the quality of the
fix and urgency. To be discussed on a case by case basis

- e.g. hot ugly fixes, aka workaround, done in urgency for a customer won't be merged to master and may be rewritten to
  finally be merged to master later.
- But the normal case it that these fixes will be merged to master.

## Conclusions

This workflow has allowed me in the past to handle multiple version (1.1, 1.2.5, 1.5) of a corporate product run by
multiple client at the same time. Even if supporting multiple version is not a desirable setup in the long run…

## Merging Two Git Repositories Into One Repository Without Losing File History

There seems to be a lot of way to merge two #git repositories into one repository without losing file history. Here is
another straightforward method.

This method do not use #submodules or #subtree merges. it uses regular merge operations.

1. Create a new empty repository New.
2. Make an initial commit because we need one before we do a merge.
3. Add a remote to old repository A.
4. Merge A/master to New/master.
5. Make a subdirectory folderA.
6. Move all files into subdirectory folderA.
7. Commit all the file moves.
8. Repeat 3-6 for another repository.

```bash
 mkdir result cd result git init touch README.MD git add . git commit -m "added readme.md"
```

Step 3 to 6

```bash
 git remote add -f A https://github.com/A.git git fetch --all git merge --allow-unrelated-histories  A/master mkdir folderA git mv -k * folderA git commit -m “moved A files into subdir folderA”
```


## Stitching several git repositories into a git fast-import stream

### git-stitch-repo

Stitch several git repositories (merging git repository) into a git fast-import stream from [Git-FastExport](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Git-FastExport/script/git-stitch-repo)

### Installation

```bash
$ perl -MCPAN -e shell    cpan[6]> i /fastexport/ 	Distribution    BOOK/Git-FastExport-0.107.tar.gz 	Module  < Git::FastExport        (BOOK/Git-FastExport-0.107.tar.gz) 	Module  < Git::FastExport::Block (BOOK/Git-FastExport-0.107.tar.gz) 	Module  < Git::FastExport::Stitch (BOOK/Git-FastExport-0.107.tar.gz) 	4 items found  cpan[6]> install BOOK/Git-FastExport-0.107.tar.gz  cpan[6]> CTRL-D
```

### Usage

git-stitch-repo will process the output of git fast-export –all –date-order on the git repositories given on the command-line, and create a stream suitable for git fast-import that will create a new repository containing all the commits in a new commit tree that respects the history of all the source repositories. Typical usage is like this:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/xxxx/A.git git clone https://github.com/xxxxx/B.git  $ ls A B  mkdir result cd result git init git-stitch-repo ../A:folderA ../B:folderB | git fast-import  # pull both repository in a new branch for examples git checkout -b newBranch git pull . master-A git pull . master-B  # when finished delete unused branches git branch -d master-A  git branch -d master-B
```
