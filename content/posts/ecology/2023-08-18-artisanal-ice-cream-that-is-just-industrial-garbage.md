Got this ice cream in the middle of the Swiss alps, I was told it is artisanal and made by the owner 's sister (Lucerne area)

## Ingredients

MILCH, Zucker, RAHM, Dunkle Schokolade, Kakaopuiver, Dextrose, Pflanzenfett, Maltodextrine, Emulsatoren: E472a, E427b, E471, E473,

Verdickungsmittel: E410, E466, E412, E401,

Magermilchpulver, Aromen

Nothing illegal, but this is not artisanal ice cream for me: probably mixing powder and milk and pressing a button

## Let 's analyse the content

### E numbers for sweeteners

#### Table 4. Sweeteners (E400s and E900s)

|Ref|Name|Description|
|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| E427| Cassia gum     | Emulsifier, stabiliser, thickener, and gelling agent     |
| E472a     | Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids     | Emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners, and gelling agents|
| E471| Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids   | Normal products of fat digestion but are prepared synthetically     | Frequently added to powdered milk, packet soup, cake, crisps, potato snacks, bread, baked products, and margarine     |
| E473| Sucrose esters of fatty acids     | Emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners, and gelling agents|     |

### E numbers for emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners, and gelling agents

#### Table 5. Emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners, and gelling agents (mainly E400s)

|Ref|Name|Description|
|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|E410    |Locust bean gum; carob gum     |Natural extract from the Carob tree seedSimilar to E407 | Added to ice cream, and soupsCarob is a non-caffeine containing substitute for cocoa and chocolateUsed in beverages, confectionery, and baked products    |
|E466    |Carboxymethyl cellulose  |Derived from cellulose with similar properties  |Used in ice cream, cream products, and cheesecake mix|
|E412    |Guar gum (cluster bean gum)    |Naturally occurring seed gum from a tree of the pea familyUsed as a thickener and stabiliser    |Added to bottled sauces, soup, ice cream, and frozen desserts    |
|E401    |Sodium alginate    |Salt of alginic acid with similar functions (see E400)|See E400 (alginic acid)|

## Why so many emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners, and gelling agents?

To put it more simply, the main benefits of emulsifiers in ice cream are:

* Improved fat emulsification in the mix
* Controlled fat agglomeration and coalescence
* Facilitated air incorporation: up to 50&, the more the better profit and volume.
* Improved dryness on extrusion
* Improved melting resistance
* Improved heat-shock stability
* Improved smoothness and creaminess

## What it really is?

This has way too much ingredients, this is a kind of ice cream powder + milk or even WATER! cool down in a ice machine to get the desired consistency.

## Good ice cream

An example of artisanal ice cream while still at small industrial scale: for example I love the Erhard Ice cream <https://www.erhard-desserts.com/boutique/chocolat>
