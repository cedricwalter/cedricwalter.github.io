Got this ice cream in the middle of the Swiss alps, I was told it is artisanal and made by the owner 's sister (Lucerne area)

## Ingredients

MILCH, Zucker, RAHM, Dunkle Schokolade, Kakaopuiver, Dextrose, Pflanzenfett, Maltodextrine, Emulsatoren: E472a, E427b, E471, E473,

Verdickungsmittel: E410, E466, E412, E401,

Magermilchpulver, Aromen

Nothing illegal, but this is not artisanal ice cream for me: probably mixing powder and milk and pressing a button

## Let 's analyse the content

## Why so many emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners, and gelling agents?

To put it more simply, the main benefits of emulsifiers in ice cream are:

  * Improved fat emulsification in the mix
  * Controlled fat agglomeration and coalescence
  * Facilitated air incorporation: up to 50&, the more the better profit and volume.
  * Improved dryness on extrusion
  * Improved melting resistance
  * Improved heat-shock stability
  * Improved smoothness and creaminess

## What it really is?

This has way too much ingredients, this is a kind of ice cream powder + milk or even WATER! cool down in a ice machine to get the desired consistency.

## Good ice cream

An example of artisanal ice cream while still at small industrial scale: for example I love the Erhard Ice cream <https://www.erhard-desserts.com/boutique/chocolat> <figure class="wp-block-image size-medium">
