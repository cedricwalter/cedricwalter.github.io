There are several reasons why it's advisable to avoid buying fake or counterfeit items! Buying fake items not only poses ethical concerns but also comes with potential risks to your safety, the economy, and the environment. Supporting legitimate businesses and adhering to ethical consumption practices helps promote a fair and sustainable marketplace.

**Ethical concerns** Purchasing fake items often supports illegal activities, including copyright infringement, intellectual property theft, and the exploitation of cheap labor. It contributes to a market that operates outside legal and ethical boundaries.

**Quality and safety concerns**  Counterfeit products are often produced without adhering to quality standards or safety regulations. This can result in substandard materials, poor craftsmanship, and potential health hazards. For example, fake medications may lack proper ingredients or dosage, posing serious risks to consumers.

**Economic impact**  The sale of counterfeit goods undermines legitimate businesses, as they lose revenue and market share to counterfeiters. This can lead to job losses, reduced innovation, and economic instability in various industries.

**Support**  for organized crime The production and distribution of fake goods are frequently linked to organized crime networks. Purchasing counterfeit items can inadvertently support criminal organizations involved in smuggling, fraud, and other illicit activities.

**No consumer protection**  Legitimate products typically come with warranties, quality guarantees, and customer support. Fake items often lack these protections, leaving consumers without recourse if the product is defective or doesn't meet expectations.

**Legal consequences**  Buying, selling, or possessing counterfeit items can have legal consequences. Individuals may face fines, confiscation of goods, or even criminal charges. It's essential to be aware of and comply with intellectual property laws.

**Impact on innovation**  Counterfeiters often mimic successful products, discouraging innovation and creativity. Genuine innovation is stifled when counterfeiters can easily profit from copying the ideas and designs of others.

**Negative**  impact on reputation Purchasing and using fake items can damage your personal and professional reputation. It may be viewed as unethical or even illegal, potentially affecting relationships and opportunities.

**Environmental impact**  The production of counterfeit goods often involves environmentally harmful practices, including the use of substandard materials and poor waste management. Supporting such activities contributes to environmental degradation.

**Loss of resale value**  Counterfeit items typically have little to no resale value, as they lack the authenticity and quality associated with genuine products. This can be a significant consideration for those who plan to resell or upgrade their possessions in the future.

## Fake Lacoste polo
Lacoste is a well-known brand, and counterfeit products are unfortunately common. Here are some things to look for when determining the authenticity of a Lacoste polo:

### Lacoste Logo
- Check the crocodile logo carefully. The authentic Lacoste logo features a high-quality, detailed crocodile. Counterfeit logos might have imperfections, such as a poorly detailed or disproportionate crocodile.
- Pay attention to the position of the crocodile. On genuine Lacoste polos, the logo is usually on the left side of the chest, and the tail points downward. Counterfeit items may have the logo misplaced or facing the wrong direction.
- In genuine Lacoste polo shirts, the crocodile emblem is positioned at the center of the left side, precisely between the bottom seam of the collar and the second button. Lesser-quality counterfeit versions frequently misalign the crocodile, placing it in line with the lower edge of the collar stitching.

### Stitching
- Examine the stitching on the polo shirt. Authentic Lacoste polos have high-quality stitching, with neat and even seams. Counterfeit items may have loose threads, uneven stitching, or poor craftsmanship.
- Polo fabric is stable and they don't change their size

### Fabric Quality
- Feel the fabric. Lacoste polos are typically made from high-quality cotton. Counterfeit items might use cheaper materials, resulting in a different texture or less comfortable feel.

### Buttons
- Check the buttons. Authentic Lacoste polos have mother-of-pearl buttons with a distinctive sheen. Counterfeit items may have plastic buttons that look dull or uneven.
- Lacoste never write the brand Lacoste on the button
- They are never made of plastic, platic is at the same temperature than the room.
- Each button is a natural product, and unique, check the marbling pattern in each. Button feel cold when touching them.
- Each button has two holes with thread passing up and down through them (rather than side to side).
- Buttons are stitched tightly to the shirt, dont get loose with time.

### Label and Tags
- Examine the labels and tags for spelling errors, inconsistencies, or poor print quality. Authentic Lacoste labels are well-made and typically do not have mistakes.
- Lacoste never write a size like 38, 42, 50 or M, L, XL, ... but always a number for the fabric size
- If it has a second tag, make sure that it says “Designed In France.
- Inspect the inner tag of the shirt to ensure that the shirt is made with 100% cotton (rather than a cotton-polyester blend). the word Devanlay should be present: Devanlay is the company that used to distribute Lacoste products.

### Color and Pattern
- Be familiar with the authentic color options and patterns of Lacoste polos. Counterfeit items may have slight variations in color or an incorrect pattern.
- Colors are vibrant and stable after washing multiple times.

### Price
- If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Lacoste is a premium brand, and significantly lower prices may indicate a fake product.

### Purchase from Authorized Retailers
- Buy Lacoste products from authorized retailers or the official Lacoste website to ensure authenticity. Be cautious when purchasing from online marketplaces or unofficial sellers.

### Packaging
- Authentic Lacoste items often come with high-quality packaging. Check for branded boxes, tags, and labels that match the brand's standard design.

If you're still uncertain about the authenticity of a Lacoste polo, consider comparing it side by side with a known authentic product or reaching out to Lacoste's customer service for verification.
