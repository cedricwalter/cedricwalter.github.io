Archaeologists have unearthed two skeletons from the Neolithic period locked in a tender embrace and buried outside [Mantua](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantua) (25 miles south of Verona).

[See location of Mantua on Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Mantua+italy&ie=UTF8&z=8&ll=45.158801,10.799561&spn=2.750169,7.646484&om=1&iwloc=addr)

With luck they will stay another 5000 years togetherâ€¦
