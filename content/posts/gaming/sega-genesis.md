Not the serial number but the FCC ID on Sega Genesis Model 1s are important to some collectors. The Id signifies whether a model 1 Genesis is Non-TMSS which means it does not show the "Produced and Licensed By Sega" before a game starts up. This also signifies if a Genesis has better sound than others since each model has a unique board and some boards have better sound output than others.

o, means that that specific Sega Genesis console is region free and will SOOOOOOOO play European and Japanese Mega Drive games (Australian as well), and what you're looking at is a serial no



w, the first number the factory it was made in (in my case, Taiwan). The second letter is the last digit of the year it was made in, so 1989. The next letter (S) is the production run. Finally, after that is the number. So mine is number 13,220 to come out of that factory's production.

According to this guide being a japanese model and having the Â® symbol next to the SEGA logo can be VA0, VA1, VA2, VA3 or VA4.

edit

Taking a look at the serial number first three characters indicate:

Factory-Year-ProductionRun

So yours was made in 1990 source: https://forums.atariage.com/topic/240155-how-low-is-your-model-1-genesis-serial-number/

So I guess most likely a VA3 or VA4 but you'll never know until you open it.
