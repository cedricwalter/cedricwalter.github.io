## A friend ask you for money on facebook, whatsapp, ...
**100% of time it is a scammer!!!**
To avoid them, just ask for a video call to assert the identity of the person asking for money. If he refuse to take a video call, report the profile as taken over, alert immediately all your friends!

## Protect yourself from unwanted calls
1. NEVER EVER pick up a phone call that is not identified. Google their number first or install a free call identifier app like local.ch
2. Your phone provider, swisscom, wingo, ... have a telemarketting filter. Check that it is active
3. Take time to bvlock everytime the unwanted phone number. These are bots, it will have no emd, but it is still your best move.
4. On iPhone you can silence caller not in your contacts list.

If you find the number in Google later and it is legit, you can always call back.
