summary: "Writing will always be a powerful form of expression. But in the age of AI, where everything online can be recorded, analyzed, and weaponized, a personal blog is no longer just a creative outlet: it’s a dataset. If you choose to write, do so with intention and awareness. The stakes are higher than ever. AI-generated video and picture influencers are poised to destabilize social networks, particularly in relation to the personal blog and online identity."

## Why having a personal blog might be a bad idea in the age of AI, there is more reasons to quit now than ever

www.waltercedric.com was created in 1997 and went through many technological mutations (static HTML, JAVA applet, Javascript, Mambo cms, Joomla cms, Wordpress cms, Jekyll and finally Hugo). Up to 1,5 millions visitors per month at it popularity peak. 

The internet once celebrated the personal blog as a digital sanctuary: a place to share thoughts, experiences, and ideas with a global audience. But the landscape has shifted dramatically. In the age of AI, the personal blog is no longer the quaint creative outlet it once was. It’s now a double-edged sword. Here's why you might want to think twice before baring your life online.

AI-generated influencers aren’t just a novelty: they’re a warning sign. As they dominate visual and social media spaces, they accelerate the decline of authenticity and marginalize the human voice. If you’re investing time in a personal blog or building a presence online, you’re increasingly shouting into a void crowded with soulless noise.

The age of AI is not just changing *how* we express ourselves online: it's changing *why* we even try!

## USA is hostile to European and rest of the world
I really dont want to fuel the US economy, or also use their infrastructure that is clearly weaponized against the interest of the rest of the world. We are not going to a Star Trek or Orville civilization. The dumb are in power.

## Chatbot chatbot chatbot
People dont use the web but ask more and more a chatbot and get a personalized answers: there is no need to click on webpages anymore, be surprised by the content, wanting to follow an author.

## Attention economy IS PRIVATIZED
People LOST -6-7 hours per day watching Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Amazon, Temu, AliExpress ... They don't read books, or visit the open web.

## Your content can be scraped and used without your consent

AI models, including those developed by major tech companies, learn from vast amounts of publicly available text: including blogs. While legal and ethical boundaries around data usage are still evolving, the reality is that once you publish online, your words can be harvested, analyzed, and repurposed by algorithms. Your thoughtful post could end up training a chatbot or being paraphrased by an AI without credit or context.

## Loss of privacy, permanently

In the age of AI-powered search and facial recognition, nothing you post is truly private: even if you delete it later. Archived content, cached pages, and third-party scrapers ensure that your blog might live on far beyond your intentions. AI tools can stitch together your digital footprint to profile your behavior, beliefs, and history in astonishing detail. That introspective essay you wrote five years ago? It could resurface in ways you never anticipated.

## AI can imitate you: perfectly

By analyzing your writing style, tone, and content themes, AI can now mimic your voice with startling accuracy. This opens up possibilities for impersonation, deepfakes, or even AI-generated phishing attacks that sound like *you*. The more you publish, the more data you offer up for these simulations. A blog that once showcased your creativity can now be a blueprint for digital forgery.

## Search engines prioritize AI-Optimized content cver personal writing

SEO in the AI era is a battlefield dominated by algorithmically generated content that’s finely tuned to rank well. Personal blogs, which typically prioritize authenticity over optimization, often get buried under waves of AI-written articles. This means fewer people will discover your work: and if they do, it might be copied or paraphrased elsewhere by content farms using AI tools.

## Your Opinions Can Be Used Against You: Forever

AI tools make it easier for employers, governments, and even strangers to search and analyze everything you’ve written. That controversial post, that angry rant, or that deeply personal story might be surfaced out of context. AI can pattern-match your blog with other data to assess your risk, personality, or trustworthiness. In a time where digital reputation matters more than ever, your personal blog could become a liability.

## The Internet Is No Longer a Neutral Playground

AI-powered recommendation systems shape what people see, read, and believe. Your blog doesn’t just compete with other blogs; it competes with engineered narratives, synthetic influencers, and content created to manipulate emotions. Even if your blog has good intentions, it may be drowned out, misinterpreted, or used as part of someone else’s agenda.

## You Become a Target for Algorithmic Manipulation

The more personal content you post, the more data is available for AI-driven ad platforms and psychological profiling tools to target you: and your readers. Blogs rich with emotional narratives, preferences, and opinions can become goldmines for micro-targeting. Your blog isn’t just content: it’s behavioral data. And advertisers, political operatives, and social engineers know how to use it.

## Originality Is Harder to Protect or Even Prove

With the explosion of AI-generated content, it's becoming difficult to prove *you* wrote something first. If an AI scrapes your blog and regurgitates it in altered form elsewhere, search engines may even rank the AI content higher: and you could appear to be the copier. Copyright laws haven’t caught up to this reality, and the burden of proof often falls on the individual creator.

## Personal Safety Risks Are Amplified

Blogging about your life: where you live, what you do, what you believe: can expose you to real-world threats. Doxxing, stalking, harassment, or swatting can result from a single post going viral or rubbing the wrong group the wrong way. In the past, this was rare. Now, with AI and advanced search scraping tools, it's disturbingly easy to compile a complete dossier on someone from just a few blog entries.

## Your Content Ages: and Not Gracefully

What seemed like a reasonable take in 2013 might be considered problematic in 2025. Cultural norms shift rapidly. A personal blog is a permanent, timestamped record of your evolving views, but the internet is rarely forgiving of nuance or change. AI systems (and people) can dig up your old posts and judge you out of context, even if you've grown or disavowed past views.

## Job Prospects and Professional Risk

Employers now routinely scan social media and blog content during hiring. A personal blog: even one not intended for professional audiences: can shape how you're perceived. AI tools that analyze sentiment, tone, and ideology can flag your blog content during background checks. Something as harmless as a political opinion, offhand joke, or emotional post might quietly disqualify you.

## You’re Fueling the Attention Economy: Unpaid

Every post you make drives traffic and engagement: for **platforms**. You may get likes or comments, but the real beneficiary is the infrastructure that harvests attention: Google, Meta, Medium, WordPress, Substack, etc. Without monetization or control, your labor and vulnerability become fuel for someone else's machine: and often, that machine is optimized *against* your own interests.

## Digital Identity Fragmentation

If you maintain a blog, social media, forums, and newsletters, you risk spreading your identity thin across platforms. It becomes difficult to control your personal narrative or enforce consistency. AI tools can cross-analyze all your content to build a "unified persona": whether you want one or not. This merging of your digital selves can backfire, especially if your blog expresses parts of you you’d rather keep compartmentalized.

## Echo Chambers and Narcissistic Feedback Loops

A personal blog can easily become an echo chamber: especially if you gain a small following that mostly agrees with you. The dopamine hit of being "heard" can trap you into performative vulnerability or ideological rigidity. The blog becomes less about exploration and more about affirmation, locking you into a digital version of yourself you no longer recognize or grow from.

## You're Competing With AI: Not Other Humans

In the early internet, your blog competed with other humans. Now, you're up against AI-written blogs that can churn out hundreds of articles per day, SEO-optimized and emotionally calibrated to outperform yours. These synthetic blogs flood Google search results and drown out personal voices. You’re not just trying to be heard: you're trying to be heard *over the noise of machines*.

## AI-Generated Influencers Are Slowly Killing Social Networks: And Authenticity

The rise of AI-generated influencers is reshaping social networks into something eerily synthetic. Hyper-realistic avatars: complete with perfectly curated appearances, scripted personalities, and algorithmically optimized content: are flooding platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. These virtual personas don’t age, don’t sleep, don’t make mistakes, and can pump out content 24/7 with machine-driven precision.

What does this mean for *you*: the real human behind a blog or an account?

## Authenticity Is Losing Its Value

Personal blogs and social media posts once thrived because they felt real: flawed, raw, and human. But AI-generated influencers mimic authenticity so well that audiences begin to prefer the polished illusion over genuine experience. These synthetic beings can "out-human" humans in terms of relatability, emotional scripting, and visual perfection. Your candid blog post about mental health? It now competes with a CGI influencer delivering an AI-written monologue about the same topic: with perfect lighting and emotional tone calibration.

## Algorithms Prefer the Bots

Social networks reward engagement: and AI-generated content, especially video and image, is designed to *maximize* it. AI influencers don’t get tired, they don’t struggle with creativity, and they never post inconsistently. That makes them algorithmic gold. The result? Human-created content is demoted in favor of high-frequency, high-performance synthetic content. This isn't just about aesthetics: it's structural. If you run a blog or a personal page, you’re being outgunned by an endless stream of data-driven avatars.

## Disillusionment and Decline

As users start to suspect that much of what they see is artificial, trust erodes. Real people disengage. Social networks become flooded with indistinguishable AI-generated personas, creating a surreal feedback loop where human interaction is minimized and performative engagement becomes the norm. Communities once built on shared human experiences become wastelands of simulated interaction.

Over time, this hollowness will hollow *out* the platforms themselves.

## The Inevitable Burnout

Competing with AI as a human creator is exhausting. Whether you’re blogging, vlogging, or posting photos, the pressure to keep up with synthetic perfection can lead to creative burnout and emotional fatigue. It’s not just that AI can do more: it’s that platforms now expect *you* to behave like a machine to stay relevant.

## So, What’s the Alternative?

If you still want to write online, consider more controlled platforms:

* Use newsletters with subscriber-only access (e.g., Substack).
* Write anonymously if you’re sharing sensitive opinions.
* Focus on private writing communities or platforms with stricter content protection.
* Keep a personal offline journal: yes, analog still has value. https://obsidian.md or any other self hosted note taking software is a good idea (but encrypt and do backups)

# My Final Words
The best is simply to QUIT and live in the real world.
Do you really want to continue seeing all these AI generated stuff and only be able to focus during 5sec till your next swipe or video reels?
Just QUIT and get back to the real world with real person interactions.
