I haven‚Äôt ordered anything from Amazon in 3 years, but suddenly I received 2 packages I never ordered. Now Riverty is forcing me to pay a bill with penalties (45 CHF).

**TL;DR:**
1. Amazon may detect the fraud and stop it, but‚Ä¶
2. Riverty can still send a debt letter. They may eventually detect the fraud and cancel everything, but not immediately.
3. Calling Riverty (+41 44 797 6740) may redirect you to their recovery service in Switzerland, Arvato.
4. Arvato may not find you in their system, but you could still receive a letter a few days later‚Äîor even 3‚Äì4 weeks later‚Äîafter Amazon requests to stop everything.

Amazon, Riverty, and Arvato are all victims of hackers. It may take time for them to detect the fraud. Each of them can notice inconsistencies (mismatched email, birthday, or name) and alert the others. The best thing you can do is **contact Amazon immediately**.

It seems the hackers‚Äô goal is not to send free gifts to strangers, but rather to make Amazon lose money and time, while upsetting customers. I lost many hours in that case too.

Going to the police only makes sense if you suffer a real financial loss. Otherwise, you‚Äôll just waste your time‚Äîand the police‚Äôs time too, since they usually prioritize more urgent cases.

You should never have to pay Riverty or Arvato for items you did not order.

**Arvato recommended me:**
* Wait, and if I get a letter from them, call their hotline again.
* If I receive new packages, do **not** open them‚Äîjust keep them.

# My Story

**June 2025**

* I received a box of *Amazon Basics pens* that I never ordered. I reported it to Amazon support the same day. They told me via chat to destroy, give away, or throw them away.
* I received a German-language book I never ordered. I reported it the same day, but got no reply. I even threatened to delete all my Amazon accounts.

**July 2025**

* I deleted all my Amazon accounts. (I hadn‚Äôt used them for 3 years anyway.)

**August 2025**

* I received a Riverty bill for June 2025!
* I recreate my Amazon accounts on 15th August just to be able to ... contact their support again üôÉ

My Amazon accounts show no suspicious activity or orders. They‚Äôve been secured with 2FA for years, and I switched to passkeys as soon as Amazon supported them.

# What‚Äôs Bad

Apparently, someone can create or steal an Amazon account, buy something for a random stranger, have it delivered to them, and then make that stranger pay later through Riverty‚Äôs monthly billing system!

Riverty‚Äôs own page makes this clear:
üëâ [https://support.riverty.com/amazon/ch\_en/](https://support.riverty.com/amazon/ch_en/)

It only requires **name, date of birth, and billing address**‚Äîall of which are commonly found in data leaks or sold by data brokers. That‚Äôs shockingly insecure.

# Solutions

1. **Contact Amazon ASAP** and explain the situation.
2. **Keep screenshots and copies** of all chats and emails. Fraud cases can take time to resolve.
3. If Riverty/Arvato contacts you, **call them directly**.

I personally spent 1 hour on the phone with a French-speaking support agent (based in Africa) who refused to speak French because it was a German hotline. He escalated the case to a ‚Äúspecialist,‚Äù but the reply was just a template (see below).

None of these explanations applied to me.

* I don‚Äôt share my account.
* I use unique passwords for all services.
* No one I know has ever ordered items for me.
* Last time i was online in amazon is maybe September 2024

# Final Note
Calling Riverty, which redirected me to Arvato, turned out to be the right move. My case does not exist in their system (yet) and may never appear.
All players‚ÄîAmazon, Riverty, and Arvato‚Äîcan detect and stop this type of fraud. But until they do, you may still receive unwanted letters. as of today, i still need to wait and hope for the best outcome!
