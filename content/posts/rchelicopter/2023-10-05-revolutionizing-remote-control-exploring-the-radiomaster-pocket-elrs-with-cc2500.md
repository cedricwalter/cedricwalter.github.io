#### Notice Title

With a cc2500, you’d be able to connect to a limited number of rc receivers – specifically ones made by (Frsky, S-FHSS, Radiolink, Graupner HoTT, Corona, and Hitec).

The “4 in 1 chip” _does handle more protocols_ than the CC2500. It has the CC2500, nRF24L01, A7105 and CYR all integrated in one package and allows you to bind with and use _Flysky, Spektrum, HUBSAN, DSM2, DEVO, J6PRO, ESKY, HISKY, KN, V2X2 and ASSAN_ receivers which you won’t be able to do with just the CC2500.

There’s a pretty good list of the protocols a 4-in-1 transmitter can talk to here – [DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module/Protocols\_Details.md at master · pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module · GitHub](https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module/blob/master/Protocols_Details.md?fbclid=IwAR2K8HhVLCC-XW6iDofQ-mpWrzDkmdJ3GHX9lqZNSqd_ublBKCAS1B5afzM)
