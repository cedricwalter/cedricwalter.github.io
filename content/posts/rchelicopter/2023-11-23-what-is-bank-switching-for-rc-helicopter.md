In the context of RC (radio-controlled) helicopters, "bank switching" typically refers to a feature related to setting up and switching between different flight modes or configurations. These flight modes often include variations in control responsiveness, stability, and other parameters to suit different styles of flying or specific maneuvers. The term "bank" here is used in the sense of a selection or setting. It require an additional channel (5 are required for RC Helicopter, so you need at least 6 or more)

Here 's a breakdown of how bank switching works in RC helicopters:

  1. **Flight Modes:**
      * RC helicopters often have multiple flight modes that cater to different skill levels or flying styles.
      * Common flight modes include Normal, Stunt, or Idle Up modes.
  2. **Switching Mechanism:**
      * Bank switching involves using a designated switch on the transmitter (the remote control) to change between these flight modes.
      * The switch could be a three-position switch or a two-position switch, depending on the helicopter 's configuration and the transmitter used.
  3. **Normal Mode:**
      * In Normal mode, the helicopter is set up for basic flying and is generally more stable.
      * This mode is often used for takeoff, landing, and general flying when precision is required.
  4. **Stunt or Idle Up Mode:**
      * Stunt or Idle Up mode is typically used for aerobatic maneuvers and 3D flying.
      * When the switch is toggled to Stunt mode, the helicopter 's control settings change to allow for more aggressive and responsive maneuvers.
  5. **Adjustable Parameters:**
      * Bank switching is not limited to just changing flight modes. It often involves adjusting various parameters, such as pitch and throttle curves, gyro settings, and expo values.
      * These adjustments allow the pilot to fine-tune the helicopter 's behavior in different flight modes.
  6. **Tail Locking:**
      * In some helicopters, bank switching may also involve tail rotor settings. For example, in Stunt mode, the tail rotor may have a higher gain to enhance stability during aggressive maneuvers.
  7. **Programmable Transmitters:**
      * Bank switching relies on programmable transmitters that allow users to assign specific functions to different switches.
      * Pilots can customize the setup to match their preferences and flying style.
  8. **Safety Features:**
      * Some bank switching setups include safety features, such as throttle hold, which quickly cuts power to the main rotor for emergency situations.

Bank switching is particularly important for pilots who want versatility in their flying experience. It allows them to smoothly transition between different flight modes, making the helicopter adaptable to various scenarios and skill levels. Pilots often tailor the bank switching setup to match their preferences and the specific requirements of the maneuvers they plan to perform.
