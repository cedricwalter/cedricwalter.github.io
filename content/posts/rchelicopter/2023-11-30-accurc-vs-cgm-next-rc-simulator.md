## Attention

AccuRC is as of today kind of abandonware, no new release in 2 years, but there is some work in progress on a 3.0.alpha. You will have to buy again the license to upgrade from AccuRC 2.0The list of abandoned RC simulator is also growing: Reflex XTR, Realflight, PhoenixRC. Root cause are piracy, non willingness to keep paying for updates,

Among the top contenders in the market, AccuRC and CGM neXt RC Simulator stand out as titans, offering cutting-edge features and realistic experiences for RC enthusiasts. In this comprehensive review, we 'll dive into the intricacies of both simulators, exploring their strengths, weaknesses, and unique features.

{{< notice note>}}
SPOILER ALERT: I did own Realflight 7.5, Reflex XTR, Phoenix 5, AccuRC 2.0, Heli-X all with proper license. The BEST simulator for RC Helicopters is [CGM neXt](https://www.cgm-online.com/rc-flight-simulator/rc-flight-simulator.html) hands down.

**Customisation and Realism Settings**

One of AccuRC 's strengths lies in its customization options. Pilots can fine-tune various settings, including weather conditions, time of day, and physics parameters, allowing for a tailored experience that mirrors real-world flying conditions.

**Issues**
* AccuRC is somehow a lot slower to start than CGM Next


## CGM neXt RC Simulator
The simulator contains 26 flight sceneries, 90 helicopters, 15 multicopters and 22 fixed-wing models. More scenes, models and functions will be added in updates
You can download the neXt flight simulator for free and test it via keyboard shortcuts. If you would like to try out your own transmitter before you buy, you can do this for 2 minutes.
There is Training videos for learning Roll, Turn, Funnel, TicTocs, Piro Flip, Piro Looping, Piro Circle, Piro TicToc, a.s.o. Press the key ‘v’ to open the flight recorder. Click on ‘Menu’ and load the desired training video.

**State-of-the-Art Graphics and Visuals**

[CGM neXt](https://www.cgm-online.com/rc-flight-simulator/rc-flight-simulator.html) is renowned for its unparalleled physics engine, providing an incredibly realistic flight experience. It takes pride in its cutting-edge graphics and visuals. The simulator employs high-quality rendering techniques, resulting in stunningly realistic landscapes, detailed aircraft models, and immersive lighting effects that elevate the overall visual experience.

**User-Friendly Interface**

[CGM neXt](https://www.cgm-online.com/rc-flight-simulator/rc-flight-simulator.html) is designed with a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced pilots. Intuitive menus and controls contribute to a seamless learning curve, allowing users to focus on refining their flying skills.

**Dynamic Weather System**

The dynamic weather system in [CGM neXt](https://www.cgm-online.com/rc-flight-simulator/rc-flight-simulator.html) adds an extra layer of challenge and excitement. Pilots can experience changing weather conditions, including rain, wind, and storms, providing a diverse and dynamic flying environment.

**Multiplayer and Online Features**

[CGM neXt](https://www.cgm-online.com/rc-flight-simulator/rc-flight-simulator.html) places a strong emphasis on multiplayer capabilities. Pilots can connect with others worldwide, engage in collaborative flights, or compete in virtual events. The online features enhance the social aspect of RC flying, fostering a sense of community. Meet your friends online in flight meetings. A maximum of up to 10 pilots can attend a room.

**Training and Tutorial Resources**

Whether you 're a novice or an experienced pilot, the simulator offers guides and tutorials to help users master advanced maneuvers and techniques.

Heli-X has a lot more tutorials and traning mode through.

## Comparative Analysis

**Realism and Physics**

[CGM neXt](https://www.cgm-online.com/rc-flight-simulator/rc-flight-simulator.html) excels in delivering an ultra-realistic flight experience, especially in terms of physics and dynamics. AccuRC, while realistic, may not match the precision of [CGM neXt](https://www.cgm-online.com/rc-flight-simulator/rc-flight-simulator.html) in this aspect. For me, I think CGM NeXt is more close to the reality out of the box.

**Graphics and Visuals**

[CGM neXt](https://www.cgm-online.com/rc-flight-simulator/rc-flight-simulator.html) takes the lead in terms of graphics and visual fidelity. Its state-of-the-art rendering contributes to a visually stunning simulation that is hard to match.

## Model library

Both offer a diverse range of aircraft. AccuRC with its bench allow you to swap more easily parts (motor, servo, ). CGM let you more change values of the physic engine.

**Customisation and Integration**

AccuRC offers extensive customization options and seamless integration with real flight controllers. [CGM neXt](https://www.cgm-online.com/rc-flight-simulator/rc-flight-simulator.html), while customizable, may not provide the same level of fine-tuning options or controller compatibility.

**User-Friendliness**

[CGM neXt](https://www.cgm-online.com/rc-flight-simulator/rc-flight-simulator.html) is praised for its user-friendly interface, making it an excellent choice for beginners. AccuRC, while user-friendly, may have a steeper learning curve due to its advanced features.

**Community and Multiplayer**

Both simulators have strong multiplayer features, but CGM neXt 's emphasis on online connectivity and community engagement gives it an edge in fostering a sense of shared enthusiasm among users.

**Integration with Real Flight Controllers, any openTX or edgeTX controller in USB mode**

Both supports a wide array of RC flight controllers, providing a seamless transition for users who want to practice with their own equipment. This integration adds an extra layer of authenticity to the simulation. CGM also sell the RX2Sim module, so you can hook your simulator like any model using a real receiver!

## Conclusions

In the world of RC flight simulation, choosing between AccuRC and [CGM neXt](https://www.cgm-online.com/rc-flight-simulator/rc-flight-simulator.html) ultimately depends on individual preferences and priorities. CGM neXt stands out for its unmatched realism and physics, making it a favorite among serious RC pilots who prioritize authenticity. On the other hand, CGM neXt impresses with its cutting-edge graphics, user-friendly interface, and strong emphasis on community engagement, making it an excellent choice for a broad spectrum of users.

Whether you prioritize realistic physics, stunning visuals, or a vibrant online community, both AccuRC and CGM neXt RC Simulator offer exceptional experiences that capture the thrill of real-world RC flying. Consider your preferences, skill level, and desired features to make an informed decision and embark on a virtual flying adventure that suits your aspirations.

I personally have bought both, but tend to prefer CGM neXt for its flight engine using a SAB Raw 700.
