{{< notice tip>}}If you’re unsure or uncomfortable making these adjustments, consider seeking assistance from an experienced RC helicopter pilot or hobby shop.{{< /notice >}}

### Correct helicopter drifting while hovering (self leveling calibration flight)

DO NOT try to correct drift using servo setup mode. that’s not what it’s meant for. Servo setup mode is for levelling the swash and setting zero pitch!

Symptoms:

*   Helicopter is forward/backward drifting,
*   Helicopter is drifting to the left or right,
*   Hovering is not stable

You have to:
1. Switch Heli on, throttle down.
2. Put Aileron (right stick down for most of us using Mode 2) down on the controller for ~5 seconds until the red LED blinking from flight board.
3. Hover and try to make it as steady as possible and land.
4. Once landed hold Aileron down again for ~5 seconds until red LED stops blinking.
Setting is now saved.

This will fix drifting issues in both stability/6G mode, and non-stabilized/3D flight modes, BUT you have to be in stability mode to do the process.

### After a crash
{{< notice warning>}}Do not try to save a few $, replace all parts that are damaged. If not the risk of injury or immediate crash is just higher{{< /notice >}}

#### Replace the tail motor
* Unmount and replace the tail rotor
* Verify the direction of rotation

### Adjusting your ESC end points

#### Why it is important to set your ESC end points

Adjusting the end points on the Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) of an RC helicopter is important for several reasons:

*   **Throttle Calibration:** Properly adjusting the ESC endpoints ensures that the throttle response of your RC helicopter is accurate and proportional. When you calibrate the endpoints correctly, you can achieve a smoother and more linear power delivery, which is essential for stable and predictable flight.

*   **Battery Efficiency:** Correct endpoint adjustment can help optimize battery efficiency. By ensuring that the motor speed matches the throttle stick input accurately, you can maximize the flight time and performance of your RC helicopter.
*   **Aerobatics:** When performing aerobatic maneuvers, precise throttle control is critical. Accurate endpoints enable you to control the motor speed with greater precision, which is essential for executing maneuvers like loops, rolls, and flips.
*   **Learning and Skill Development:** As you progress in your RC helicopter piloting skills, you may need to adjust the endpoints to match your flying style and specific helicopter setup. Beginners may prefer a more forgiving throttle response, while experienced pilots may require a more precise and responsive setup.
*   **Preventing Overheating:** Inaccurate endpoints can lead to the motor running at higher or lower RPMs than desired, potentially causing overheating or excessive wear and tear. Proper calibration helps ensure the motor operates within safe and optimal temperature ranges.

#### How to adjust the ESC end points

{{< notice warning>}}Before changing any Flight controller settings ensure that the Helicopter is bound to the radio and throttle cut is active. It is recommended to remove the main and tail rotor blades to prevent any injury if the motors accidentally start up.{{< /notice >}}

The Flight controller is configured with a combination of SET button presses and Radio controller stick movements.

Move throttle stick to 100% and power on helicopter. Once the controller is initialised (swash plate jumps) move throttle to 0%
Your ESC end points are now set and you can power off the helicopter.

### Adjusting the servo mid-point

#### Why it is important to set servo mid-point

Adjusting the servo mid-point on a remote-controlled (RC) helicopter is important for several reasons:

*   **Control Center:** Servos are responsible for controlling various aspects of the helicopter, such as the swashplate, tail rotor, or other functions. The servo mid-point sets the neutral or center position for these servos. Correctly adjusting the servo mid-point ensures that the helicopter starts from a balanced and centered position when you power it up.
*   **Trimming:** Proper servo mid-point adjustment is essential for trimming the helicopter’s controls. When the servos are centered correctly, it’s easier to achieve a stable hover, and the helicopter responds predictably to your control inputs. If the servos are not centered, you may have to apply constant input to keep the helicopter stable, leading to unnecessary pilot workload.
*   **Stability:** A well-adjusted servo mid-point contributes to the helicopter’s overall stability. If the servos are not correctly centered, it can lead to unwanted drift, oscillations, or instability during flight. Centered servos provide a solid starting point for flight control adjustments.
*   **Precision Maneuvers:** When performing precision maneuvers or aerobatics, having correctly centered servos is critical. It allows for precise control of the helicopter’s movements and ensures that it responds predictably during rolls, flips, loops, and other advanced maneuvers.
*   **Tail Rotor Control:** The tail rotor servo is especially sensitive to the servo mid-point. Correctly setting the mid-point for the tail rotor servo ensures that the helicopter maintains a stable heading and effectively counters the main rotor’s torque.
*   **Reducing Stress on Servos:** If the servos are not properly centered, they may constantly work against each other, leading to increased wear and tear and reduced servo lifespan. Centered servos reduce unnecessary stress and extend the lifespan of the components.
*   **Learning and Skill Development:** Adjusting the servo mid-point can also be helpful as pilots progress in their skill level. Beginners may start with factory settings for simplicity, while more experienced pilots may fine-tune the mid-points to match their flying style and specific helicopter setup.
*   **Aiding Setup and Maintenance:** When building or maintaining an RC helicopter, having correctly centered servos simplifies the setup process. It ensures that the helicopter is mechanically balanced and ready for fine-tuning and calibration.

In summary, adjusting the servo mid-point on an RC helicopter is crucial for achieving precise control, stability, and performance. It serves as a starting point for many other adjustments and helps ensure that the helicopter responds predictably to pilot inputs, ultimately enhancing the flying experience and safety.

#### How to adjust the servo mid-point

The Flight controller is configured with a combination of SET button presses and Radio controller stick movements.

Adjusting the servo mid-point on an RC helicopter involves making precise mechanical adjustments to the servo arms and linkages. Here’s a general step-by-step guide to help you adjust the servo mid-points:

**Tools and Materials Needed:**

*   Hex wrenches or screwdrivers
*   Servo arm/horn adjuster or servo centering tool (optional but helpful)
*   A level surface
*   Knowledge of your RC helicopter’s manual and components

**Procedure:**

*   **Read the Manual:** Always refer to your specific RC helicopter’s manual for guidance on servo mid-point adjustment. The manual will provide information on your helicopter’s setup and specifications.
*   **Power Off:** Ensure that the helicopter’s power is turned off and the transmitter is disconnected to prevent accidental movements of the servos during the adjustment process.
*   **Level Surface:** Place your RC helicopter on a level surface. This ensures that the helicopter is in a neutral orientation, which is crucial for accurate servo mid-point adjustment.
*   **Access Servos:** Depending on your helicopter’s design, you may need to remove covers or panels to access the servo arms.

*   **Center Servo Arms:**
To center you servo you can either:
  * Power up the heli but keep the radio off
  * Using a servo arm adjuster or servo centering tool (if available), set the servo arms to their center position.
If you don’t have these tools, you can manually center the servo arms as closely as possible by aligning them with the servo case and ensuring that they are parallel to the helicopter’s frame.

*   **Adjust Linkages:** To fine-tune the servo mid-points, you may need to adjust the linkages connecting the servo arms to the control surfaces (e.g., swashplate, rotor blades). This can involve adjusting the lengths of pushrods or turnbuckles. Many helicopters have threaded linkages, so you can use hex wrenches or screwdrivers to make these adjustments.
*   **Check Control Surface Alignment:** As you make adjustments, regularly check that the control surfaces are properly aligned and that the swashplate is level.
*   **Test and Refine:** Once you’ve made adjustments, power on the helicopter and the transmitter. With the transmitter stick at neutral, check that the servos return to their centered positions. If not, make further adjustments to the linkages or servo arms until you achieve the desired mid-point. Test for smooth and consistent control response.
*   **Repeat for All Servos:** You’ll typically have to perform this process for all relevant servos on your RC helicopter, including cyclic servos, collective pitch servos, and the tail rotor servo.
*   **Final Check:** After making all the adjustments, double-check that the helicopter maintains its level position when the transmitter sticks are at neutral. Also, ensure that control inputs result in smooth and precise movements.
*   **Secure and Reassemble:** Once you’re satisfied with the servo mid-points, secure the linkages, servo arms, and any covers or panels that you removed. Make sure everything is properly fastened.
*   **Test Flight:** Conduct a test flight to ensure that the helicopter is stable and responsive after the adjustments. Fine-tune as needed.

Remember that the specifics of servo mid-point adjustment may vary depending on your helicopter’s make and model, so always consult your manual and follow manufacturer recommendations. If you’re unsure or uncomfortable making these adjustments, consider seeking assistance from an experienced RC helicopter pilot or hobby shop.

### Adjusting the yaw gain

#### Why it is important to set yaw gain

Adjusting the yaw gain setting on a remote-controlled (RC) helicopter is important for several reasons:

*   **Tail Rotor Control:** The yaw gain setting affects the responsiveness of the tail rotor, which is responsible for controlling the helicopter’s yaw or heading. A well-adjusted yaw gain ensures that the tail rotor responds appropriately to your input, helping to maintain stable and precise directional control.
*   **Heading Hold:** Many RC helicopters are equipped with a “heading hold” or “gyro” feature. This feature relies on the yaw gain to maintain the helicopter’s heading. Proper adjustment of the yaw gain helps the helicopter hold its heading more accurately, especially during maneuvers or windy conditions.
*   **Stability:** Correctly setting the yaw gain contributes to the overall stability of the helicopter. A properly tuned tail rotor system with the right gain setting helps prevent tail wag, which can negatively impact flight stability and control.
*   **Yaw Rate Control:** The yaw gain affects how quickly the tail rotor reacts to yaw input from the pilot. Adjusting the yaw gain allows you to fine-tune the helicopter’s yaw rate, providing you with the level of responsiveness and precision you desire for your flying style and the specific flight conditions.
*   **Aerobatics:** The yaw gain setting is particularly important when performing aerobatic maneuvers that require precise yaw control, such as pirouettes and autorotations. By adjusting the yaw gain, you can tailor the helicopter’s behavior to meet the demands of these maneuvers.
*   **Wind Compensation:** Yaw control is essential in windy conditions, as wind can cause the helicopter’s heading to drift. The yaw gain can be adjusted to optimize the tail rotor’s response to wind, helping to maintain heading stability.
*   **Learning and Skill Development:** As with other control settings in RC helicopters, the yaw gain can be adjusted to match the pilot’s skill level and preferences. Novice pilots may start with lower gains for more forgiving and stable flight, while experienced pilots can use higher gains for greater precision and responsiveness.
*   **Tail Vibration Control:** Adjusting the yaw gain can also help reduce tail rotor vibrations, which can affect the overall smoothness and performance of the helicopter.

In summary, adjusting the yaw gain setting on an RC helicopter is vital for achieving precise control, stability, and responsiveness in controlling the helicopter’s heading. Tail rotor control is critical to maintaining stability and executing various maneuvers, and fine-tuning the yaw gain allows pilots to optimize the helicopter’s behavior for their skill level and specific flight conditions.

### How to get the swashplate leveled / servo trim

![](/2023/10/omhobby-m2-rc-helicopter-servi-trim-1024x720.webp)

On a levelled table, turn off self leveling by going in 3D mode.

*   Center your collective pitch stick and don’t touch it or the helicopter.
*   Look at all 3 servo arms. Are they EXACTLY 90° level to the helicopter body?
*   If they are off by a lot (shouldn’t be the case) you can try removing the servo arm and re-installing it. Maybe it’ll be better on tooth off from how it currently is but it’s unlikely to be that far off from the factory.
*   If the servo arms are off center just a little bit use servo trim on the controller to get all 3 servos as close as you can to perfectly centered. Press 3 s on set. press set again to move to servo settings. use sticks to center.

Once the servos are centered adjust the linkages (length or shorten) from the servos to the swashplate so it’s level. Jiggle the collective and cyclic sticks and then re-center the collective stick to check your work.

## Preventive maintenance

Performing preventive maintenance on your RC helicopter can help ensure its longevity and optimal performance. Here are some key areas where you can apply preventive maintenance:

1. Rotor Blades:
Regularly inspect rotor blades for any signs of damage, such as cracks or chips.
Check for balance and adjust if necessary.
Ensure that blades are securely attached.

2. Main Gear and Motor Pinion:
Inspect the main gear and motor pinion for wear or damage.
Lubricate gears if needed.
Ensure proper alignment.

3. Battery and Power System:
Check the battery for any signs of swelling or damage.
Inspect power connectors and wires for wear or fraying.
Verify proper voltage and capacity.

4. Frame and Body:
Inspect the frame for cracks or damage.
Check the body for loose or broken parts.
Ensure that all screws and bolts are tight.

5. Tail Rotor and Servo:
Inspect the tail rotor blades for damage.
Check the tail rotor servo for proper operation.
Ensure the tail rotor is securely attached.

6. Linkages and Swashplate:
Inspect linkages for wear or damage.
Check the swashplate for proper movement.
Lubricate moving parts if necessary.

7. Electronic Components:
Check the receiver and transmitter for proper function.
Inspect electronic speed controllers (ESCs) and other onboard electronics.
Ensure proper antenna placement for optimal signal reception.

8. Landing Gear:
Check the landing gear for any signs of damage.
Ensure that it provides stable support.

9. Screws and Fasteners:
Regularly check all screws and fasteners for tightness.
Consider using thread locker to prevent vibrations from loosening screws.

10. Gyro and Flight Controller:
Inspect the gyro for proper function.
Ensure that the flight controller settings are calibrated correctly.

11. Bearings:
Check all bearings for smooth operation.
Replace bearings that show signs of wear or rough movement.

12. Cleanliness:
Keep your RC helicopter clean from dirt and debris.
Use compressed air or a brush to remove dust and particles.

## Controler

TALY?
Around August 2020 OMP added a feature called TALY which much improved left yaw authority
If you want to check open the flight controller case and check the version number of the ESC. V4 ESC has TALY, anything earlier doesnt.

### EdgeTX files for M1 EVO & M2 EVO Helicopters

{{< notice tip>}}I recommend you to use the omphobby protocol, support telemetry and work great with a 4 in 1 radiomaster multi module. {{< /notice >}}

#### Jonas setup
 {{< notice info>}}Jonas’ programming rescue mode waits for the heli to upright, then applies a known positive pitch to climb (with the amount of applied pitch being dependent on flight mode).
OMPHobby EVO radio files for Radiomaster Zorro and TX16S, for both SFHSS and DSM2/X satellites. [https://www.helifreak.com/showthread.php?t=916037](https://www.helifreak.com/showthread.php?t=916037){{< /notice >}}

Important things to note
* Files may be updated without notice if issues are found or when I find ways to optimize them further.
* These setups are provided as-is, should be understood as a recommendation and may not suit everyone.
* I assume no liability for the things you do with your helicopters using my setups.
* Check all flight controls, functions and switches without blades before your first flight.
* I cannot provide individual support for these setup files. Especially for installation instructions, Google is your friend.
* These setup files require EdgeTX 2.7.0 or newer to function. I can not and will not provide OpenTX files.
* Choose the correct setup file for your receiver type. Simply changing the receiver type in the radio WILL NOT WORK.

##### Analyzing the setup

Channel Function Direction
1	Aileron	(Inverted)
2	Elevator
3	Throttle
4	Rudder	(Inverted)
5	Stability mode (ON/OFF)
6	Collective Pitch

Flight modes are used: RPM, Pitch and Rescue Pitch are different in the main 3 Flightmodes, the 6POS even lowers the low-RPM Flightmode's RPM further.



In EdgeTX, the "input" (stick positions) from the sticks travels to the RF channel output (signal out the RF module) like this:
Sticks (hardware) ⇒ Inputs (config) ⇒ Mixer (config) ⇒ Outputs (config) ⇒ RF module (hardware)

###### Logical switches
Freely assignable switches through Logical Switches menu


L04: Switch F -> throttle hold
L04: Switch E -> throttle hold
L08 : reset timer, throttle hold, SE & SF


###### Curves
HLD: curve that maintain the throttle at 0
CP1: collective pitch curve for normal mode with pitch -100 to 100
CP3: collective pitch curve for idle-up 1 with pitch -95 to 95
CP3: collective pitch curve for idle-up 2 with pitch -90 to 90

CPL: collective pitch curve beginner friendly (no negative collective) with self level mode and reduced rates

DBD: dead band curve
Deadband was adressed in a 5POS-Curve for aileron and elevator saying -100=-100, -1=-8, 0=0, 1=8, 100=100. Therefor -7 to 7 is skipped.
Jonas dealt with the deadband by mixing "ail" and "ele" with the curve "dbd"

Add a deadband removal curve then coutereact that by adding positive expo... because with the combination of the two is taking out the deadband first, so that even the slightest stick input from 0 results in a rotation of the helicopter, and then reshaping the resulting curve beyond the deadband so that a certain amount of stick travel, even beyond the deadband, results in a rotation rate that is comfortable for the pilot.

Deadband negates the first 5% of your input completely,
Expo reshapes the entire control curve for more lenient or aggressive rotation rate for a given input.

Features
*
* Deadband fix preapplied, expo ready (set expo in Mixes tab)
* Three flight modes with dedicated collective curves
* Custom rescue mode with flight mode dependent collective curves
