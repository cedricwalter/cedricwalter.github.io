My first full size build since 2004, what a jump in size compare to my two Omphobby m2 :sweat_smile:

### Buying a used RC (Radio-Controlled) helicopter carry some risks
Buying a used RC (Radio-Controlled) helicopter can be a great way to save money, but it also comes with certain risks.
It's essential to conduct a thorough inspection and ask pertinent questions before making a purchase. If you're not familiar with RC helicopters, consider bringing along someone with experience or seeking the advice of a knowledgeable friend or expert in the hobby.

Here are some potential risks and considerations to keep in mind:

**Condition of the Helicopter:**
- **Physical Damage:** Check for any visible signs of damage such as broken or bent parts, cracks, or missing components.
- **Wear and Tear:** Assess the overall wear and tear on the helicopter. Overused components may be more prone to failure.

**Mechanical Components:**
- **Motor and Servos:** Check the motor and servos for proper function. Listen for any unusual noises during operation.
- **Battery Health:** Batteries degrade over time. Ensure that the battery is still holding a charge well and hasn't swollen, as this can be a sign of damage or age.

**Electronics and Wiring:**
- **Receiver and Transmitter:** Verify that the RC transmitter and receiver are in good working condition. Check for any loose or damaged wiring.
- **Electronic Speed Controller (ESC):** Ensure that the ESC is functioning properly and not showing signs of overheating.

**Flight History & Crash History:**
Inquire about any crashes the helicopter might have had. Frequent crashes can lead to hidden damage and affect the overall performance.

**Availability of Spare Parts:**
Check if spare parts for the specific model are readily available in case you need to replace or repair components.

**Upgrades and Modifications:**
Find out if the previous owner made any modifications or upgrades to the helicopter. While some upgrades can enhance performance, poorly executed modifications may lead to issues.

**Documentation and Manuals:**
Ensure that the seller provides you with the user manual and any relevant documentation for the helicopter. This will be helpful for maintenance and troubleshooting.

**Price Considerations:**
Research the market value of the specific model you are interested in. If the price seems too good to be true, it might be worth investigating further.

**Test Flight:**
If possible, request a test flight to observe the helicopter in action. Pay attention to how it handles, any abnormal vibrations, or erratic behavior.

**Trustworthiness of the Seller:**
Consider the reputation of the seller. If buying from an individual, ask questions about the helicopter's history and maintenance.

## SAB Goblin RAW 580 Setup
{{< notice tip>}}Work in Progress{{< /notice >}}

### Setup found on the web
{{< youtube kAloFJgVKSk >}}

## EdgeTX files
{{< notice tip>}}This SAB 580 edgeTX configuration based on [Jonas Wackershauser](https://www.youtube.com/user/Johnny31297) omp hobby m2 configurations, What I consider the most advanced, freely and open source edgeTX configuration available.
{{< /notice >}}

In EdgeTX, the "input" (stick positions) from the sticks travels to the RF channel output (signal out the RF module) like this:
Sticks (hardware) ⇒ Inputs (config) ⇒ Mixer (config) ⇒ Outputs (config) ⇒ RF module (hardware)

### Features
* Deadband fix preapplied, expo ready (set expo in Mixes tab)
* Three flight modes with dedicated collective curves
* Custom rescue mode with flight mode dependent collective curves
* Zorro: RPM reduction switch intelligently combined with self level switch to enable additional headspeeds
* TX16S: 6-pos switch allows for 5 additional, lower RPMs in lowest headspeed setting
* Dual throttle hold switch for safety with timer reset function if both switches are pulled

### Radiomaster Zorro Default switch assignments
* A: Rescue button
* B: Flight mode switch (3 fixed RPMs)
* C: 3D mode headspeed switch reduction, self leveling with headspeed reduction
* D: N/A
* E: Throttle hold switch 1
* F: Throttle hold switch 2
* G: N/A
* H: N/A

{{< notice warning>}}
* File may be updated without notice if issues are found or when I find ways to optimize them further.
* This file is tested on RadioMaster Zorro and use the external ELRS module.
* These setups are provided as-is, should be understood as a recommendation and may not suit everyone.
* I assume no liability for the things you do with your helicopters using this setup.
* Check all flight controls, functions and switches without blades before your first flight.
* I cannot provide individual support for these setup files. Especially for installation instructions, Google is your friend.
* These setup files require EdgeTX 2.9.0 or newer to function.
* I can not and will not provide OpenTX files.
* Feedback is welcome

### Setup details

| Channel  | Function  | Direction  |
|---|---|---|
|  1 | Aileron | Inverted  |
| 2  | Elevator |   |
| 3 | Throttle |   |
| 4 | Rudder  | Inverted |
| 5 | Stability mode (ON/OFF)  |  |
| 6 | Collective Pitch  |  |

Flight modes are used: RPM, Pitch and Rescue Pitch are different in the main 3 Flightmodes, the 6POS even lowers the low-RPM Flightmode's RPM further.

Freely assignable switches through Logical Switches menu
L04: Switch F -> throttle hold
L04: Switch E -> throttle hold
L08 : reset timer, throttle hold, SE & SF

#### Curves
* HLD
  * curve that maintain the throttle at 0
* CP1
  * collective pitch curve for normal mode with pitch -100 to 100
* CP3
  * collective pitch curve for idle-up 1 with pitch -95 to 95
* CP3
  * collective pitch curve for idle-up 2 with pitch -90 to 90
* CPL
  * collective pitch curve beginner friendly (no negative collective)
  * With self level mode
  * With reduced rates
* DBD: dead band curve
  * Deadband was adressed in a 5POS-Curve for aileron and elevator saying -100=-100, -1=-8, 0=0, 1=8, 100=100. Therefor -7 to 7 is skipped.
  * The deadband is achieved with the deadband by mixing "ail" and "ele" with the curve "dbd"

{{< notice tip>}}
* Deadband negates the first 5% of your input completely
* Expo reshapes the entire control curve for more lenient or aggressive rotation rate for a given input.

Add a deadband removal curve then coutereact that by adding positive expo... because with the combination of the two is taking out the deadband first, so that even the slightest stick input from 0 results in a rotation of the helicopter, and then reshaping the resulting curve beyond the deadband so that a certain amount of stick travel, even beyond the deadband, results in a rotation rate that is comfortable for the pilot.

# Which Rotorflight FBL Controller
I recommend you to use one of the dedicated FBL controller designed for RF2
- Flydragon F722 or
- Radiomaster Nexus

{{< notice tip>}}Flydragon F722 designer is available for help on discord, "Mo" User that I want to credit here for his help
I will also help improving the documentation later in http://www.rotorflight.org

The Google drive with all files you will ever need  from the manufacturer is
