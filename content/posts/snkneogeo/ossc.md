Introduction
The Open Source Scan Converter is a low-latency video digitizer and scan converter designed primarily for connecting retro video game consoles and home computers to modern displays. It converts analog RGB or component video signals into a digital format, and doubles (or triples) the scanlines of a single frame if necessary to generate a valid mode for digital TVs or monitors.

OSSC V1.8 New Features:
Improved Hardware Compatibility:

Version 1.8 includes revisions to the hardware to improve compatibility, especially in terms of sync/mode detection.
Shadow Mask CRT Simulation:

This feature emulates the shadow mask effect found behind traditional CRT screens, offering users a more authentic retro gaming experience.
HDR Mode:

The addition of HDR (High Dynamic Range) mode provides a wider color range and contrast, making the images look more vivid and lifelike.
1440p Pixel Repetition Mode:

This feature allows the OSSC to enhance image quality when outputting at 1440p resolution by repeating pixels, which is useful for users who want better image quality on high-resolution displays.
Improved Power/Ground Supply Distribution:

With a new 4-layer PCB design, version 1.8 improves the distribution of power and ground, contributing to overall performance and stability.
Inherited Features from Version 1.7:

This includes over-voltage protection, an improved audio switching switch, and reduced temperature and power consumption. These improvements have been carried over to version 1.8.
