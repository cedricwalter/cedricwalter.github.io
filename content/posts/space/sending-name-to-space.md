While your name physically remains on Earth, the act of sending it into space symbolizes the human spirit of curiosity, exploration, and the continuous quest for knowledge. It's a unique and distinctive experience that you can share with friends and family, making for interesting conversations and stories to tell. When you submit your name, NASA often provides a digital certificate or boarding pass with your name on it. This serves as a digital memento and a reminder of your participation in a historic space mission.

Sending your name to space with NASA is also the ultimate Nerdy move. Your name will be lost in the void of the galaxy or on another planet nearly forever...long after your death.

# To the Moon in Viper Rover with Artemis -- Launch 2024 - Arrival 2024
VIPER is planned for delivery to the lunar surface in late 2024 under NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative. During its 100-day mission VIPER will travel several miles, over crater rims and occasionally into permanently shadowed craters – which are one of the coldest places in our solar system – to sample different kinds of lunar soils and environments.

VIPER represents the first resource mapping mission on another celestial body and will deepen our understanding of how frozen water and other volatiles are distributed on the Moon, their cosmic origin, and what has kept them preserved in the lunar soil for billions of years.

# Message in a bottle Jupiter Orbit Launch -- Oct. 2024 - Arrival 2030
My name will be on board NASA’s Europa Clipper spacecraft as it travels 1.8 billion miles to explore Jupiter’s icy moon!

NASA’s Message in a Bottle campaign invites people around the world to sign their names to a poem written by the U.S. Poet Laureate Ada Limón. The poem connects the two water worlds — Earth, yearning to reach out and understand what makes a world habitable, and Europa, waiting with secrets yet to be explored. The campaign is a special collaboration, uniting art and science, by NASA, the U.S. Poet Laureate, and the Library of Congress.

The poem is engraved on NASA’s robotic Europa Clipper spacecraft, along with participants' names that will be stenciled onto microchips mounted on the spacecraft. Together, the poem and names will travel 1.8 billion miles on Europa Clipper’s voyage to the Jupiter system. Europa Clipper is set to launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in October 2024, and by 2030, it will be in orbit around Jupiter. Over several years, it will conduct dozens of flybys of Jupiter’s icy moon Europa, gathering detailed measurements to determine if the moon has conditions suitable for life.

# To the Moon with Artemis -- Nov. 16, 2022 landed Dec. 11, 2022
Artemis I was the first in a series of increasingly complex missions that will enable human exploration at the Moon and future missions to Mars.

NASA is inviting people to send their names to the surface of the Moon aboard the agency’s first robotic lunar rover, VIPER – short for Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover. The rover will embark on a mission to the lunar South Pole to unravel the mysteries of the Moon’s water and better understand the environment where NASA plans to land the first woman and first person of color under its Artemis program.

# To our Sun with Parker solar probe 2018

The Parker Solar Probe (PSP; previously Solar Probe, Solar Probe Plus or Solar Probe+) is a NASA space probe launched in 2018 with the mission of making observations of the outer corona of the Sun. It will approach to within 9.86 solar radii (6.9 million km or 4.3 million miles) from the center of the Sun, and by 2025 will travel, at closest approach, as fast as 690,000 km/h (430,000 mph) or 191 km/s, which is 0.064% the speed of light. It is the fastest object ever built.

# Bennu Asteroid Belt 2016

NASA is inviting people around the world to submit their names to be etched on a microchip aboard a spacecraft headed to the asteroid Bennu in 2016.

The “Messages to Bennu!” microchip will travel to the asteroid aboard the agency’s Origins-Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft. The robotic mission will spend more than two years at the 1,760-foot (500-meter)-wide asteroid. The spacecraft will collect a sample of Bennu’s surface and return it to Earth in a sample return capsule.

# Faces in Space 2011
This certifies that the face of Cedric Walter has flown in space aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery on mission STS-133 from February 24 - March 9, 2011. The face was flown on Discovery's mission to the International Space Station at an altitude of 220 miles above the Earth. It flew at a speed of more than 17,400 miles per hour as it orbited our planet. On behalf of my crew and all of NASA, we thank you for sharing the excitement of our mission and welcome your interest in space exploration. We were glad to have you aboard.

![faces-in-space-cedricwalter-boarding-pass-nasa](/space/faces-in-space-cedricwalter-boarding-pass-nasa.webp)

Visitors to the "Face in Space" website can upload their portrait to fly with the astronauts aboard shuttle Discovery's STS-133 mission and/or shuttle Endeavour's STS-134 mission. Participants will receive special certificates from the Internet site once the mission is completed.

# To the Moon with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter 2008

# Pluto New Horizons mission Shedding Light on Frontier Worlds (2005)
In addition to the scientific equipment, there are several cultural artifacts traveling with the spacecraft. These include a collection of 434,738 names stored on a compact disc, a piece of Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne, and an American flag, along with other mementos. About an ounce of Clyde Tombaugh's ashes are aboard the spacecraft, to commemorate his discovery of Pluto in 1930. A Florida-state quarter coin, whose design commemorates human exploration, is included, officially as a trim weight. One of the science packages (a dust counter) is named after Venetia Burney, who, as a child, suggested the name "Pluto" after the planet's discovery.

The US$650 million New Horizons mission was launched January 19, 2006 atop an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida and has so far traveled 3 billion miles (4.8 billion km). The 1,054 lb (478 kg) nuclear-powered probe is on a 9.5-year mission to fly by Pluto and then on to study selected objects in the Kuiper Belt. Sent on a slingshot trajectory using the gravitational pull of Jupiter, New Horizons passed the orbit of Neptune on August 24 last year and will rendezvous with Pluto on July 14 2015, which it will pass at a distance of 8,000 miles (13,000 km).
