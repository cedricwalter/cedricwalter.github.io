I'm French and I can tell you that is really EASY to save some serious money in the Swiss health system.

Price of medicaments is not regulated like in France (I admit there it is insanely low), example some time ago Amoxicillin is 1.20 euro for 20 pills and 45.- CHF for 12 pills in Zürich (generika!). It should be possible to find a way to regulate prices

Number of pharmacy is regulated in france too, is it bad? no! you don't need a pharmacy every 200m

Don't pay back perlimpinpin/fake medicines...like bioresonance? homeopathy, Craniosacral therapy (CST) and more...

I used to work for Health insurer and Switzerland don't need 40 insurances companies burning cash like hell with employees and back office (horrible back office code BTW)

Having my doctor on the phone? 134 CHF for 5min. Going to the Urologue 345 CHF (42 euro in France without exams) so it is time to recognise that 
Doctor must be regulated too, not only patients

Cleaning the teeth plaque? 200 CHF while 24 euro in France

Yeah I shop my medicaments in France and if I am not in life threatening conditions just visit the doctor there not caring about the franchise not taken into account.
