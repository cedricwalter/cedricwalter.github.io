I think we never ask ourselves why we need social media in the first place...

## You're more alone than ever

You may have 400 friends and none if not a few are here for you when you need them,

## Security issues

You expose your private sphere to friends and then some hacker get into one account of one of your friend and it is over

## Waste of time

You are up to 3-5h a day watching reels and swiping, you don't enjoy your life. it could add up to 9 years of your total life!

## AI is killing social networks

With AI more and more fake pictures and posts will be posted and tailored to act as a magnet for your profile. It has never been easier to profile you (you are the product)

## Why we care again about all this shit?

At which point we have collectively decided to post and like what we are eating, our travels, cat, clothes, ...?

we ended up in the current situation mainly because of these social networks....(bots, Russian manipulation, hacks, theft, populism, anti vax, ...) I don't think humanity need social networks. We just need to again enjoy meeting real people in real life again...
