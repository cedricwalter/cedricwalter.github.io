**Lanyards or Energy Absorbers: These are used to attach yourself to the via ferrata cable. Energy-absorbing lanyards are designed to reduce the impact force in the event of a fall.

The sling, which is attached directly to the climbing harness, is designed for users weighing between 40 and 120 kg according to the EN 958: 2017 standard.

## Climbing Gloves
Sturdy gloves protect your hands from abrasions and enhance grip when handling the via ferrata equipment, cables, and metal fixtures. ## Appropriate Footwear: Sturdy hiking boots or approach shoes with good traction are essential to provide grip on rocky terrain and for stepping on rungs and footholds.

## Clothing
 Wear comfortable and weather-appropriate clothing. Consider lightweight, moisture-wicking layers that allow for freedom of movement. Depending on the climate and conditions, you may need a windproof or waterproof jacket as well.

## Backpack
A small backpack can carry essentials such as water, snacks, a first aid kit, and any extra layers of clothing.

## Sunglasses and Sunscreen
Protect your eyes and skin from the sun’s rays, as via ferrata routes can often be exposed to direct sunlight.

## Navigation and Safety Equipment:
Depending on the route and location, you may need a map, compass, or GPS device. Additionally, a whistle, a small flashlight, and a multi-tool can be useful.

## Personal First Aid Kit
Carry a basic first aid kit for minor injuries.

## Water and Snacks
Stay hydrated and bring energy-boosting snacks to maintain your energy levels. ##

## Buying a Via Ferrata Set
This specialized set usually includes two lanyards with carabiners, designed specifically for via ferrata climbing. Some sets also incorporate an energy-absorbing element. Remember that the equipment you choose should be suited to your level of experience, the difficulty of the route, and the specific conditions of the via ferrata. Before embarking on a via ferrata climb, it’s essential to have proper training, know how to use the equipment correctly, and follow safety guidelines. If you’re new to via ferrata, consider going with a certified guide who can provide instruction and ensure your safety throughout the climb.
