## Location & access

The via ferrata is accessed from Kandersteg (c. 1176 m) or directly from the Allmenalp valley station (c. 1181 m).

Walking in from the valley station is fairly quick, or there’s a short hike from Kandersteg alongside the Allmibach stream to reach the start, at about 1250 m.

The via ferrata is open roughly from mid-May (or June) to mid/late October, depending on weather and cable car operation.

Return options: cable car, hiking descent (via Ueschinental or other paths, typically 1.5 h–2.5 h), or tandem paraglider.

## Route characteristics

Total length \~650 m, height gain \~550 m, of which about 370 m is “via ferrata” climbing.

Requires good stamina and comfort with exposure, rated **K4** (difficult, exposed).

The route starts with a vertical wall, then moves through a dramatic gorge with four waterfalls of the Allmibach, crosses via **Nepal-style three-rope bridges**, traverses a twisted ladder structure (a 180° turn suspended ladder), and includes **two tyroliennes** (zip lines), one 50 m long, another 110 m long (only accessible with a guide).

The variant called **“Freude herrscht”**, added around 2020, graded **K4+**. It’s shorter (\~240 m, 150 m elevation gain) but more exposed and vertical, intended for climbers with more experience.

Climbers will find a variety of terrain: iron steps, ladders, rope bridges, zip lines, traverses, and natural rock climbing aided by the fixed gear.

## Things to watch out for

* Although stunning, the route can be slippery or wet, especially around the waterfalls. Rain or thunderstorms make parts dangerous or impossible. 
* It’s exposed and physically demanding, so it's not ideal for beginners or those with a fear of heights, unless they’re very fit, have prior via ferrata experience, or go with a guide.
* It can get crowded on weekends or in good weather, which might slow things down or make certain sections congested. 
* Return logistics: if the cable car shuts early or the weather changes, descent options include a fairly long hike or potentially a glider flight, so plan carefully.

## Why it’s worth doing

* Very scenic: climbing right alongside and above waterfalls is dramatic and beautiful. 
* Great variety: ladders, bridges, zip lines, traverses and natural terrain make it a dynamic, engaging via ferrata—not just a grind up some iron pegs. 
* Good accessibility: close to public transport, with a short walk or cable car to get in and out. 
* Flexible: you can make it a full outing with the cable car, or link it to a hike or paragliding descent. 
* The “Freude herrscht” variant offers a steeper, more technical option for those looking for a tougher challenge or wanting to avoid crowds on the main route.

## My Tips

* The normal version is not so difficult but very long, expect to make it in 3H, but I completed it in 1.5 with 2 short breaks.
* You can only climb using the safety line, so using good all fingers gloves is a must.
* Take 2L of water if you can, it is exposed and there is no shadows, I was drying up at 22°C air on 18 September 2025.
