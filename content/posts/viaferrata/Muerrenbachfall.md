The Mürren–Gimmelwald Via Ferrata is one of Switzerland’s most spectacular alpine adventures. Stretching 2.2 km along sheer cliffs high above the Lauterbrunnen Valley, this unique route descends from Mürren to Gimmelwald, crossing ladders, rope bridges, and even a suspension bridge with breathtaking views of the Bernese Alps. Rated as moderately difficult, it’s a thrilling experience for those with a good head for heights, proper equipment, and a sense of adventure.

## Highlights (What makes it special)

* The descent itself is unusual for via ferratas, so that gives a different experience compared to many which predominantly ascend.)
* There are sections with steel ladders, metal rungs, wire ropes securing exposed rocky parts. 
* A tyrolienne (zip-line) is part of the route — but its use is restricted (only with a mountain guide) and when not in use the route has a bypass (rope bridge). 
* A suspension bridge (“Nepal bridge”) toward the end provides a dramatic crossing.)

## Requirements, safety & equipment

* Good physical condition, sure-footedness, and no fear of heights are necessary. Because some parts are steep, exposed, and demand comfort with being clipped in and exposed.)
* Required equipment includes: climbing harness, via ferrata set (i.e. lanyards / energy absorber + carabiners), helmet, sturdy shoes, gloves. 
* If inexperienced, going with a mountain guide is highly recommended.)
* The weather matters: the route must be done in good weather. Rain, thunderstorms are no-good (wet metal = slippery, dangerous). 

## Logistics & access

* **Start point**: Mürren. Specifically, from Mürren you go to the Sportchalet, then a short walk (\~10 min) to the via ferrata tunnel entrance.)
* **End point**: Gimmelwald station. After the via ferrata and the final bridge / trails through alpine meadows.)
* Equipment rental (if needed) is available in Mürren (Intersport). 
* Guided tours are offered.)

## Things to watch out for / tips

* Because it descends, some parts can feel more exposed than upwards trails. Pay close attention to clipping in at all times.
* If it’s been raining (or rain is forecast), metals will be slippery. It’s essential to check the forecast.
* Start early enough so you’re not rushed (since route is open only until 18:00).
* Be prepared for both exposed cliff sections and easier, forested/less exposed stretches.

## My notes

An easy via ferrata that require stamina at the beginning with a very exposed path, but maximum 15m in length. This is the place where most people take pictures for social networks.
It is mainly a long walk down in the wood, steep, secured by a via ferrata. 3 bridges. The last bridge being very long and with a lot of heights below. The scaring effect is amplified because at the beginning and the end of that bridge, you can not grab the bridge line on both side and must use the safety line.

Still it is a long one, with plenty of wow effects!
