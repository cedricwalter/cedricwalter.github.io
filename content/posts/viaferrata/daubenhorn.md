## The Daubenhorn Via Ferrata: A Complete Guide

Nestled above the thermal village of **Leukerbad** in the Swiss Alps, the **Daubenhorn Via Ferrata** is one of Europe’s longest and most iconic Klettersteig routes. With ~1,000 meters of vertical gain, airy traverses, ladders, and stunning alpine scenery, it’s a bucket-list challenge for adventurous hikers.

But this isn’t your average Sunday outing — it’s a **serious full-day alpine adventure**. Here’s everything you need to know before clipping in.

### What Makes Daubenhorn Special?

* **Length:** ~8–10 hours total depending on comfort and fitness
* **Height Gain:** ~1,000 m
* **12 steel ladders** with a total length of 216m
* **2000m** of steel cables
* **Difficulty:** K5/K6 (advanced)
* **Exposure:** **Very high** — sheer drops and long vertical sections
* **Season:** Mid-July to late September (when snow and ice have melted)

* Small Ferrata: 2 hrs and exit or add
* Large Ferrata: 3¾ hrs. (Altogether 5¾ for the full tour to the Daubenhorn)
With descent to Gemmipass total: 8 Std.

You’ll encounter:

* Long ladder systems
* Steel cables and rungs
* Narrow ledges
* A famous exposed traverse
* Alpine terrain on the exit

It rewards you with **panoramic views of the Valais Alps**, including the Rhône valley and surrounding 4,000-meter peaks.

### When to Start

This is a **long, committing route**, so timing is crucial.

**Recommended start time:**
**7:00 AM (or even earlier)** in summer

Why?

* Afternoon storms are common in the Alps
* You need daylight for the descent
* The route can get busy — early = fewer bottlenecks

**Weather matters:**
Only go in **dry, stable weather**. Rain, wind, or thunderstorms drastically increase risks on exposed iron steps and cables.

### How to Approach the Start

Approach: 20 mins

Trail begins above Leukerbad. Most climbers start from **Gemmibahn valley station** and follow signs to *Klettersteig Daubenhorn*.

Expect:

* ~1–1.5 hours hiking to the via ferrata start
* A warm-up scramble section

### How to Exit

After topping out near the Daubenhorn ridge:

**DO NOT plan to descend the via ferrata** — it’s not designed for down-climbing.

Standard exit:

* Follow the **marked trail** down toward Leukerbad
* Optional: connect to **Gemmipass** and take the *Gemmibahn* cable car (knees will thank you!)

Descent time: ~2–3 hours
(Shorter if taking the cable car)

### Key Safety Considerations

This route is **not for beginners**. You should be comfortable with:

* Exposure and heights
* Using a via ferrata lanyard safely
* Long days in alpine terrain
* NEVER GO ALONE!!!

#### Gear essentials

* Certified VF set (lanyards with energy absorber)
* Maybe carry another VF set in case the first open after a fall and you are not injured.
* Climbing helmet
* Harness
* Gloves (for cables)
* Sturdy hiking or approach shoes
* Layers — alpine weather changes fast
* Plenty of water (little to no water en-route), you need a lot of water also because a large part is in full sun !
* High-energy snacks

#### Be cautious of

| Risk                  | Why It Matters                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Exposure              | Uneasy with heights = retreat becomes hard |
| Weather shifts        | Lightning + steel = dangerous              |
| Fatigue               | Long, sustained climb — endurance matters  |
| Rockfall              | Especially from parties above              |
| Snow/ice early season | Makes holds and cables risky               |

### Is a Guide Needed?

Recommended if:

* You’re new to via ferrata
* Unsure about exposure
* Traveling solo

Experienced climbers can go independently — but treat it like a **serious alpine route**.

### Pro Tips

* Hydrate + eat well before starting
* Bring a warm layer & windproof shell
* Test gear before the trip — this is not the place for first-time lanyard use
* Pace yourself: it’s long, not sprint-hard
* Check Leukerbad tourist office or cable car station for conditions updates

### Final Thoughts

The **Daubenhorn Via Ferrata** is a thrilling challenge for adventurous climbers — not just a pretty hike. Start early, respect the route, pace yourself, and you’ll earn one of the most spectacular alpine days Switzerland has to offer.

If you’re ready for exposure, endurance, and unbeatable views — it might just become one of your favorite adventures.
