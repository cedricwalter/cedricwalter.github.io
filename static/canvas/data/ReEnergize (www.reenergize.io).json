But we are less using Blockchain than helping the crypto-mining ecosystem. Because our USP in that way is: if mining is unprofitable, it is because of the high electricity costs. By using ReEnergize\u00b4s TCC machine, miners can slow down the energy costs\r\n\u2022 on the other hand blockchain enables us to put data on it. Therefore investors get noticed about all incoming streams, so they can calculate the intrinsic value of token (beyond the worth of the scalability of the ecosystem)","outsideId":"\u2022 delivery partners (waste, bio-waste, plastic, tires) and companies who are buying the output crude material\r\n\u2022 workers at the TCC-power plant\r\n\u2022 mining-partner and users who are using the platform to mine cryptocurrencies\r\n\u2022 gamers, who inject computing power","incentivesId":"\u2022 the ICO will include a airdrop-program as well a community bounty program. moreover we will work out a media cooperation deal","tokenId":"\u2022 Pre-Sale\r\n\u2022 Public-Sale \r\n\u2022 Soft-cap is at 10 Mio EUR\r\n\u2022 a large part of the incoming streams are re-invested into the ecosystem to let TCC-powerplants and mining factory grow. therefore there is a real calculate-able value on the computing power part, as well on the input- & output streams of the waste\/crude material \r\n\u2022 Moreover the ecosystem scales through it`s platform.
