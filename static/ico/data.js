They added that trading virtual currencies in Poland does not violate national or EU law, however, having virtual \\\"currencies\\\", involves many risks: (1) risk related to the possibility of loss of funds due to theft, (2) risk related to lack of guarantee, (3) risk of lack of universal acceptability, (4) risk related to the possibility of fraud, (5) risk of high price change. Because of these risks, the NBP and KNF warn against buying virtual currencies and investing in them. The NBP and KNF recognize that the purchase, possession and sale of virtual currencies by entities supervised by the KNF (e.g. banks) would be burdened with high risk and would not ensure a stable and prudent management of the financial institution.

They are also required to have KYC and CDD policies and procedures in place, in accordance with the Ministerial Regulation Prescribing Rules and Procedures for Customer Due Diligence, Reference Page 8 Volume 129 Part 44 A Government Gazette 23 May 2555 (2012).[119] Suspicious activity must be reported to the Anti-Money Laundering Office (Thailand) (AMLO), of Thailand.[120] The SEC Thailand encourages access to funding for businesses, including high potential tech startups, and realizes the potential of ICO in answering startups\\u2019 funding needs. In cases where an ICO constitutes offering of securities, the issuer will need to comply with applicable regulatory requirements[121] The SEC Thailand issued a Public Consultation Document Aor Tor Ngor 34\\\/2560 27 October 2017 Topic: Regulatory approach on Initial Coin Offering (ICO)[122] As of February 2018 the Thai central bank has prohibited financial institutions in the country from five key cryptocurrency activities[123]. These include 1) Investing or trading in cryptocurrency 2) Exchanging cryptocurrencies 3) Creating platforms for cryptocurrency trading 4) Allowing clients to use credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies 5) Advising customers on cryptocurrency investing and trading. Banks complying with these new rules include Bangkok Bank, SIAM Commercial Bank and Krungsri. On 29-6-2018 The SEC and Revenue Department of Thailand announced that Bitcoin trading would be subject to 15% Capital Gains Tax and 7% VAT. Exchanges would be required collect 15% Withholding and 7% VAT on all trades. This will require all customers of Bitcoin Exchanges to provide purchase price information to the Exchange, who will be required to track and report all trades. This announcement has the potential to a) Make regulated exchanges unprofitable b) Move trading in Thailand to exchanges that have not registered and are prepared to run the risks associated this not registering c) Move Bitcoin buy\\\/sell business to LocalBitcoins.com, unregulated and unregistered individual traders that do not follow KYC rules. Because the approach of the SEC and Revenue Department is to invite companies to register, but are still unclear on the logistics of collecting taxes, anyone registering takes on significant risk if the Revenue Department decides to change the rules and backdate the changes. Note: The Revenue Department will not allow trade losses to be offset against profits.<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory#Thailand\" target=\"_blank\"> sources [wikipedia.org]<\/a>',) ],
