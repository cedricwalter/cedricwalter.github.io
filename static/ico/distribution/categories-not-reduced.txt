 the golem network token (\"gnt\") account is a core component of golem and is designed to ensure flexibility and control over the future evolution of the project. gnt is created during the crowdfunding period (described in this whitepaper) and
 following the first major release of golem
 gnt will be attributed a variety of functions in the golem network. \u25cf payments from requestors to providers for resource usage
 and remuneration for software developers is going to be exclusively conducted in gnt. \u25cf once the application registry and transaction framework are implemented
 gnt will be necessary for other interactions with golem
 such as submitting deposits by providers and software developers or participation in the process of software validation and certification (as described in the application registry section). \u25cf the general conditions for using gnt will be set in the transaction framework
 but specific parameters of these interactions will be possible to define within each software integration. the golem network token is a token on ethereum platform. its design follows widely adopted token implementation standards. this makes it easy to manage using existing solutions including ethereum wallet. \u25cf maximum number of tokens created during crowdfunding period: \u25cb total: 1 000 000 000
