israel,,bancor,153.0,"The Bancor protocol is a standard that allows anyone to easily create completely liquid “smart tokens” that calculate their own prices & enable a single party to convert any token to another, without requiring a second party to exchange with. Thereby enabling the long-tail of completely liquid cryptocurrencies. Smart tokens hold other tokens in reserve, and can be used as decentralized token baskets (like ETFs), token changers (like shapeshift), project & protocol tokens (like GNT & REP), community currencies (like Ithacash & reward miles), and a lot of other use cases. The BANCOR network token will hold a single reserve in Ether. Other smart tokens, by using BANCOR as (one of) their reserve(s), connect to the BANCOR network. The BANCOR network token forms a monetary structure where increased demand for any of the network’s smart tokens drives up the value of the common BANCOR token, benefiting all other smart tokens holding it in reserve.",BNT,12th Jun 2017,12th Jun 2017,https://www.bancor.network,Israel,https://www.bancor.network/static/bancor_protocol_whitepaper_en.pdf
