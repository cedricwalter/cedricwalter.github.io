While a solution for those needs exists individually across many platforms, they are not always implemented to perfection, and are often unreliable, non-transparent or hard to use. By aggregating those components into one platform, we enhance user experience and eliminate redundancy, fees, and funds transition time. The 5 main components of the system are the Exchanges: HybriDEX multi-chain dex and n.ex- change INSTANT, MultiPick multi-mining pool, EasyMerchant solution, and a line of complementary services including high-quality content, various utilities leveraging our open API, coin capitalization and portfolio trackers and liquidity-sourcing services. Our goal is to maximize every one of the components individually, by providing an outstanding service with a sharp edge, for low fees. Thus becoming the industry’s first regulated, transparent, high-liquidity A-Book broker. As such, our main business model is sourcing liquidity to traditional financial institutions and blue-chip companies.",NEX Token,1st May 2019,29th May 2019,https://n.exchange/ico,UK,https://n.exchange/n_exchange_whitepaper.pdf
UK,,nuvo,,"Nuvo is a blockchain network on which decentralized, regionally-focused social media communities can be built. It is defined by two core features of (i) an unbiased, uncensorable news feed, and (ii) automatic payment in Nuvo tokens for participation on social networks; with participation including posting content, sharing content, and voting or commenting on content. Through a chain-based voting process, communities built on Nuvo automatically filter out low-quality content, fake news, and postings that are irrelevant or in poor taste. With a model that pays users for engagement, community members are incentivized to post and share high-quality, high-integrity content, as well as to vote/comment corresponding to what they feel about postings that they see, so that what shows up in a user’s news feed reflects the opinions of the community’s actual members; uninfluenced by any advertising algorithm or political agenda.",NUVO,19th Apr 2019,19th May 2019,https://jamaa.com,UK,https://jamaa.com/docs/whitepaper

It provides a coordinated decentralized network based on 3D Printing technology and will expand to other manufacturing environments. Within this framework, the benefits of manufacturing and 3D Printing become a global common infrastructure for all. Anyone can access the network, become a stakeholder in its development, add a fabrication technology (e.g. 3D Printer) to 3D-Chain’s ecosystem, add a new design or customize existing one, and receive network payment tokens in exchange. Moreover, demand for personalized design is exponentially growing every year and soon dominate the manufacturing and the economy since personalized items are more appealing to customers than mass-produce items. However, manufacturing new items and personalized them are very expensive and time-consuming. 3D-Chain facilitates the mass customization.",3xD,1st Jan 2019,30th May 2019,http://www.3dchain.io,USA,https://www.3dchain.io/doc/3Dchain_whitepaper.pdf

USA,,fr8 network,1.213222,"The $700B US trucking industry is the backbone of American commerce with 80% of all cargo transported overland by trucks, yet it is plagued with inefficiency and ultimately controlled by a bloated intermediary brokerage system whose incentives are not aligned with the true stakeholders. Imagine forming a blockchain platform bringing together shippers, carriers, truckers and brokers where they can place and track orders, assess performance records, compare pricing and extend credit. Add in a set of decentralized applications (DApps) linking up these stakeholders--and a new digital token speeding their transactions--and you could cut billions of dollars in inefficiencies from the $700 billion-dollar-a-year trucking industry. That is the vision of Fr8 Network, a newly formed upstart that aims to take the pain out of shipping by targeting, in particular, the $66 billion a year in fees exacted by some 16,000 middleman brokerages. Some key points: · Potential savings are huge. Trucks travel an astounding 29.6 billion miles every year only partially loaded or entirely empty--a waste of capacity even as businesses struggle with a shortage of drivers. · Cut that unused capacity in half, and we could save $30 billion a year in fuel costs and reduce carbon emissions from trucks by 100 million tons per year, 20% of their total carbon output. · By matching customers to and carriers online, the industry could sidestep broker fees that pose up to 20% of the cost of shipping goods; cut fees in half and the industry saves some $30 billion.",FR8,16th Apr 2019,22nd May 2019,https://fr8.network,USA,https://drive.google.com/file/d/17UV10bQIOHBbGtcpKPYSeIgnD2jTo70H/view
