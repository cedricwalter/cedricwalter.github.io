This coin is like a prototype of a Billboard, where the owners of this token, that is, advertisers, can place a message in the contract line for only 1 GZM. The advertiser can place this message on the billboards in different cities, on websites and all visitors will see what is specified in the global parameter of the messange. This coin was created on the ERC-20 contract. The total number of issued and coins for mining does not exceeds 1 billion. The mining of this coin is also unique because it allows to generate GZM tokens with low power renewable energy.

USA,,muse protocol,,"Anyone familiar with the music industry knows there are copyright and royalty payment systems enforced in most countries through government regulation. This is to ensure musicians and artists are compensated for the use of their performances. For an artist to benefit from these royalty regimes they must be a member of a recognized rights performance organization. The problems with the current model are notably described in a report from the Rethink Music initiative at the Berklee College of Music’s Institute for Creative Entrepreneurship. The difficulty of tracing who owns what performances. The report states, “20–50 percent of music payments don’t make it to their rightful recipients.” Money flows in the music industry are very complicated and not well understood by most artists. Record and publishing companies deliberately try to obscure what they owe and to whom, and pay what they own very slowly. On top of these problems is the fact that independent artists around the world are typically left out of the royalty system altogether because they are not signed to a distribution label and not a member of a professional rights performance organization in their country. This leaves independent artists unable to benefit from royalty regimes, even if they are flawed. Muse Protocol is here as an innovative approach to autonomous and transparent means of royalty distribution. We aim to solve this major problem in the Music industry. Muse Protocol is the foundation that Muse Incorporated is built on. It is an innovative approach to an autonomous and transparent means of royalty distribution and media rights ownership. It is a next-generation publicly verifiable piece of technology dedicated to bringing transparency and ground-breaking innovation to the way the music industry operates. Muse Protocol is a Blockstack digital ecosystem built on a set of automatic, pre-arranged agreements, called smart contracts, that allows for the trust free management of profit generated by music and the transformation of fanbases into their own symbiotic economies. Muse Protocol is capable of autonomously handling any event thrown at it including; registering a artist or listener account, registering works of art for ownership, verification of DMCA abuse, automatic collection of earned royalties, automatic distribution of collected royalties, and much, much more. Muse is a decentralized social streaming platform that favors artists and creatives while rewarding participants for engagement and consumption. Muse Application and Muse Platform are the heart and brain of Muse Incorporated.
