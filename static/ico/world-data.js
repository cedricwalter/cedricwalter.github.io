Other objectives would include maintaining Malta\u2019s reputation and protecting consumers.  The MDIA would also bear responsibility for certifying technology arrangements and registering technology services providers under the \u201CTAS Bill.\u201D\n\u00B7The \u201CTAS Bill\u201D would establish a regime for the registration of technology service providers and provide for the certification of certain technology arrangements.  This regime will initially cover distributed ledger technology platforms and related contracts. 274]  The proposals would require technology service providers that provide services for any distributed ledger technology platform in or from Malta be certified by the MDIA. Those who provide these services in other specified cases may voluntary register with the MDIA.\nThe Virtual Currency Bill would establish a framework for ICOs and a regulatory regime that would apply to certain services relating to cryptocurrencies, such as brokers, wallet providers, and virtual currency exchanges. The Times of Malta has reported that the government is considering introducing its own cryptocurrency \u201Cwithin a \u2018controlled framework,\u2019 which would enable regulators to test possible controls and legislation for the technology.\u201D  The Virtual Currency Bill aims to regulate ICOs that relate to virtual currency not falling within the existing legislation.  The bill will ensure that the offerings meet transparency requirements and will incorporate obligations that apply to initial public offerings that the issuer must follow.\nThe MFSA has also proposed a \u201Cfinancial instrument test\u201D that would enable individuals to determine,\n\nwith regulatory certainty[,] . . . whether, based on its specific features, an ICO or a VC [virtual currency] falls within the scope of the existing legislative framework, reflecting EU law on the subject, or if not, whether this will be required to comply with the new regulatory framework being proposed by the MFSA.\n\nThe test proposed would be a two-stage test, the first of which would determine whether a cryptocurrency is a financial instrument within existing Maltese or European Union legislation.  The second stage would determine if the cryptocurrency was an asset under the proposed Virtual Currency Bill.\n\nThe MFSA would be the regulator for the financial services contained in the Virtual Currency Bill, and would have regulatory and investigatory powers that reflect those contained in the country\u2019s other financial services laws, including the authority to suspend an ICO or trading of a cryptocurrency.\n\nThe government has also established a National Blockchain Strategy Taskforce to advise the government on a framework for distributed ledger technologies.

['Switzerland',5,  leg('Switzerland','5','168','60','36','84','The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has started to examine ICOs for possible breaches of securities laws, which may be the first signs of a new wave of campaigning for regulatory oversight. Regulations are not thought, however, to be able to stop the current momentum to incorporate ICOs into Swiss culture. Utility tokens, which would generally not be considered securities if they have a use or can be exchanged for a service. However, the purchaser must be able to use the token at the time of the ICO. Payment tokens (cryptocurrencies), which would not be classified as securities. Asset tokens, which are widely considered securities and are subject to Swiss Securities Laws; and Hybrid tokens, which will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis\n\nOn February 16, 2018, FINMA published guidelines on the regulatory treatment of ICOs,[15] which complement its earlier FINMA Guidance from September 2017. 16] Currently, there is no ICO-specific regulation, nor is there relevant case law, or consistent legal doctrine. 17] FINMA stated that due to the fact that each ICO is designed in a different way, whether and which financial regulations are applicable must be decided on a case-by-case basis. In an ICO, investors receive blockchain-based coins or tokens in exchange for the funds they transfer. The tokens are created and stored either on a blockchain specifically created for the ICO or on a pre-existing blockchain. 18]\n\nFINMA differentiates between payment tokens (cryptocurrencies), utility tokens, and asset tokens. Payment tokens (cryptocurrencies) are defined as tokens that are used as a means of payment or as a means of money or value transfer. Utility tokens are those that provide digital access to an application or service by means of a blockchain-based infrastructure. Asset tokens represent assets such as a debt or an equity claim against the issuer. According to FINMA, asset tokens are analogous to equities, bonds, and derivatives. 19]\n\nOperators of financial market infrastructures are subject to authorization by FINMA. 20] If the tokens received in an ICO qualify as securities, trading will require authorization. \u201CSecurities\u201D are defined as \u201Cstandardised certificated or uncertificated securities, derivatives and intermediated securities which are suitable for mass standardised trading,\u201D [21] meaning they are \u201Cpublicly offered for sale in the same structure and denomination or are placed with more than 20 clients, insofar as they have not been created especially for individual counterparties.\u201D[22] FINMA does not treat payment tokens or utility tokens whose sole purpose is to confer digital access rights as securities. However, utility tokens that have an additional investment purpose or a sole investment purpose at the time of issue, as well as asset tokens that are standardized and suitable for mass standardized trading, are classified as securities. 23]\n\nFunds raised in an ICO generally do not qualify as deposits within the meaning of the Banking Act. However, if there are liabilities with debt capital character\u2014for example, a promise to return capital with a guaranteed return\u2014then such an ICO would require the organizer to obtain a banking license. 24] When assets collected as part of the ICO are managed externally by third parties, the provisions of the Collective Investment Schemes Act apply. 25] Provisions on combating money laundering and terrorist financing (Anti-Money Laundering Act) apply to the ICO of a payment token (cryptocurrency) as soon as the tokens can be technically transferred on a blockchain infrastructure. 26]','In Switzerland, the individual cantons, the Swiss states, are obligated to levy income tax and wealth tax on the total property (assets and rights with a cash value) of taxpayers that are resident in their canton. 492] Tax rates vary between the individual cantons. Cryptocurrencies are treated like foreign currencies for tax purposes and are subject to wealth tax. 493] Holders of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are taxed at the rate determined by the tax authorities on December 31 of the fiscal year. As an example, the tax rate for bitcoin determined on December 31, 2017, by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration was CHF13,784.38 (about US$14,514). 494] This rate is a recommendation for the cantonal tax authorities.\n\n<h3>1. Wealth Tax<\/h3>\nIn Switzerland, the individual cantons, the Swiss states, are obligated to levy income tax and wealth tax on the total property (assets and rights with a cash value) of taxpayers that are resident in their canton. 29] Tax rates vary between the individual cantons. Cryptocurrencies are treated like foreign currencies for wealth tax purposes. 30] Holders of bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies are taxed at the rate determined by the tax authorities on December 31st of the fiscal year. As an example, the tax rate for bitcoins determined on December 31, 2017, by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration was CHF13,784.38 (about US$14,500). 31] The Swiss Federal Tax Administration provides tax rates for other cryptocurrencies in addition to bitcoins. 32] These rates are a recommendation to the cantonal tax authorities for wealth tax purposes, but most follow them. The rates are based on the average value of different trading platforms. 33]\n\n<h3>2. Income Tax<\/h3>\nIf an employee receives bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies as a salary or benefit, it forms part of his or her taxable earned income. The Swiss Franc value of the cryptocurrency at the time it was received must be recorded on the salary statement. 34]\n\nIf a self-employed person receives bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies for providing goods or services, it must be included as part of the principal or additional income from self-employment at the Swiss Franc value of the cryptocurrency at the time it was received. 35]\n\nAny income that a natural person derives from mining cryptocurrencies by making available computational power for consideration must be included as assessable income for tax purposes. Depending on the specific work arrangement (employee or independent contractor), the compensation received will count as income from salaried work or self-employment. 36]\n\n<h3>3. Professional Cryptocurrency Trading<\/h3>\nIf cryptocurrency trading is done on a professional basis, any profits are taxable and losses are tax deductible. Cryptocurrencies that qualify as business assets are reported on the balance sheet with the book value. Price fluctuations have to be accounted for according to general accounting principles. 37]\n\n<h3>4. Capital Gains Tax<\/h3>\nCapital gains from movable private assets, which include cryptocurrencies, are generally not subject to taxation and any capital losses are therefore not tax deductible. 38]','','The Anti-Money Laundering Act generally applies to \u201Cfinancial intermediaries,\u201D who are defined as natural and legal persons who accept or hold deposit assets for third parties or who assist in the investment or transfer of such assets on a professional basis. 10] In its 2014 report, the Federal Council concluded that professional trading in virtual currencies and the operation of trading platforms in Switzerland generally come under the scope of the Anti-Money Laundering Act and therefore give rise to a range of due diligence obligations. 11] The due diligence requirements include verifying the identity of the contracting party and establishing the identity of the beneficial owner. 12]\n\nFINMA guidelines clarified that anti-money laundering legislation is applicable to persons who exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat money and vice versa as well as for a different cryptocurrency on a commercial basis (cryptocurrency exchanges), and to custodian wallet providers. 13]','Switzerland classifies virtual currencies as assets (property). It has relaxed regulatory burdens on and entry barriers for innovative Fintech companies, while keeping risks associated with Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies related to investor protection, financial crime, and cyber threats in mind. There are currently no ICO-specific regulations, but depending on how the ICO is designed, financial market laws may be applicable. This is assessed on a case-by-case basis. Money laundering and securities regulation are the most relevant laws in this respect.

They are also required to have KYC and CDD policies and procedures in place, in accordance with the Ministerial Regulation Prescribing Rules and Procedures for Customer Due Diligence, Reference Page 8 Volume 129 Part 44 A Government Gazette 23 May 2555 (2012).[96] Suspicious activity must be reported to the Anti-Money Laundering Office (Thailand) (AMLO), of Thailand.[97] The SEC Thailand encourages access to funding for businesses, including high potential tech startups, and realizes the potential of ICO in answering startups\\u2019 funding needs. In cases where an ICO constitutes offering of securities, the issuer will need to comply with applicable regulatory requirements[98] The SEC Thailand issued a Public Consultation Document Aor Tor Ngor 34\\\/2560 27 October 2017 Topic: Regulatory approach on Initial Coin Offering (ICO)[99] As of February 2018 the Thai central bank has prohibited financial institutions in the country from five key cryptocurrency activities.[100] These include 1) Investing or trading in cryptocurrency 2) Exchanging cryptocurrencies 3) Creating platforms for cryptocurrency trading 4) Allowing clients to use credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies 5) Advising customers on cryptocurrency investing and trading. Banks complying with these new rules include Bangkok Bank, SIAM Commercial Bank and Krungsri. On 29-6-2018 The SEC and Revenue Department of Thailand announced that Bitcoin trading would be subject to 15% Capital Gains Tax and 7% VAT. Exchanges would be required collect 15% Withholding and 7% VAT on all trades. This will require all customers of Bitcoin Exchanges to provide purchase price information to the Exchange, who will be required to track and report all trades. This announcement has the potential to a) Make regulated exchanges unprofitable b) Move trading in Thailand to exchanges that have not registered and are prepared to run the risks associated this not registering c) Move Bitcoin buy\\\/sell business to LocalBitcoins.com, unregulated and unregistered individual traders that do not follow KYC rules. Because the approach of the SEC and Revenue Department is to invite companies to register, but are still unclear on the logistics of collecting taxes, anyone registering takes on significant risk if the Revenue Department decides to change the rules and backdate the changes. Note: The Revenue Department will not allow trade losses to be offset against profits.<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory#Thailand\" target=\"_blank\"> sources [wikipedia.org]<\/a>',) ],
