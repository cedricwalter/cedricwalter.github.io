UK,,nuvo,,"Nuvo is a blockchain network on which decentralized, regionally-focused social media communities can be built. It is defined by two core features of (i) an unbiased, uncensorable news feed, and (ii) automatic payment in Nuvo tokens for participation on social networks; with participation including posting content, sharing content, and voting or commenting on content. Through a chain-based voting process, communities built on Nuvo automatically filter out low-quality content, fake news, and postings that are irrelevant or in poor taste. With a model that pays users for engagement, community members are incentivized to post and share high-quality, high-integrity content, as well as to vote/comment corresponding to what they feel about postings that they see, so that what shows up in a user’s news feed reflects the opinions of the community’s actual members; uninfluenced by any advertising algorithm or political agenda.",NUVO,19th Apr 2019,19th May 2019,https://jamaa.com,UK,https://jamaa.com/docs/whitepaper
USA,,fr8 network,1.213222,"The $700B US trucking industry is the backbone of American commerce with 80% of all cargo transported overland by trucks, yet it is plagued with inefficiency and ultimately controlled by a bloated intermediary brokerage system whose incentives are not aligned with the true stakeholders. Imagine forming a blockchain platform bringing together shippers, carriers, truckers and brokers where they can place and track orders, assess performance records, compare pricing and extend credit. Add in a set of decentralized applications (DApps) linking up these stakeholders--and a new digital token speeding their transactions--and you could cut billions of dollars in inefficiencies from the $700 billion-dollar-a-year trucking industry. That is the vision of Fr8 Network, a newly formed upstart that aims to take the pain out of shipping by targeting, in particular, the $66 billion a year in fees exacted by some 16,000 middleman brokerages. Some key points: · Potential savings are huge. Trucks travel an astounding 29.6 billion miles every year only partially loaded or entirely empty--a waste of capacity even as businesses struggle with a shortage of drivers. · Cut that unused capacity in half, and we could save $30 billion a year in fuel costs and reduce carbon emissions from trucks by 100 million tons per year, 20% of their total carbon output. · By matching customers to and carriers online, the industry could sidestep broker fees that pose up to 20% of the cost of shipping goods; cut fees in half and the industry saves some $30 billion.",FR8,16th Apr 2019,22nd May 2019,https://fr8.network,USA,https://drive.google.com/file/d/17UV10bQIOHBbGtcpKPYSeIgnD2jTo70H/view
