Artificial Intelligence,,alfa-enzo,,"Alfa-Enzo is patented social mining platform that lets the community solves the most critical problems of the blockchain—scaling and mass adoption. It uses a patent-pending side-chain process to let you mine tokens by discovering and interacting with social contents on the network. The patented design was developed from scratch to ensure that you earn for your time and anything you create from posts to transactions. The more you give to the network, the faster you earn. Powering Alfa-Enzo's ecosystem is Enzo (NZO). Enzo is a time-token that converts the user's time into a stored value. It is mined using a special Proof-of-Activity (PoS + PoW) protocol that's designed to properly compensate users for the time they spent from social activities to marketplace activities. Miners can transact with the tokens, or sell the tokens on exchanges to Advertisers and Publishers who need the tokens to serve advertisements. Tokens are burned when Advertisements are injected into the system, which continually create a fair increase in value and demand for tokens . Alfa-Enzo holds a number of patents and will provide its source code for open-review in April 2019. It is a presently in MVP status with a baseline release of its social mining app ALFA for iOS, and on track to deliver the first Android version in November 2018. Users will be retroactively reimbursed for their time spent on the network after the launch of its main-net in 2019.",NZO,16th Nov 2018,21st Jun 2019,https://www.alfaenzo.io,Cayman Islands,https://www.alfaenzo.io/libs/pdf/whitepaper.pdf
