Energy,,green funding coin,,"Green Funding Platforms (GFP) is a new crowdfunding platform for ESG Investment with a visible flow of funds by Green Funding Coin (GFC). ESG Investment refers incorporating Environmental, Social and Governance factors into investment decisions. ESG investments already operate with a market cap of over 25 Trillion USD. By utilizing Blockchain Technology, GFP can make the flow of investment 100% traceable, transparent, and unalterable. GFC is the key currency used to invest and pay out on GFP. When coin holders use GFP, they send GFC to the entity they wish to invest in. The entity will return the yield of rate to investors in GFC. The investors can take the return with them or reinvest in other entities. GFC is designed to have a low volatility because the price of GFC is fixed from pre-sale period until listing on exchanges to avoid a crash right after listing due to high sell pressure. Thanks to its design and the above eco-system, investors will enjoy an increase of the value of GFC steadily and sustainably as well as investment itself. Those currently investing in GFC are more wealthy, sophisticated investors. This is because they are aware that ESG related investments are more sustainable in the long run. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNTPTS1hhfTkHEKzz8WpAEg https://www.tokendesk.io/ico/green-funding-coin/",GFC,2nd Apr 2019,31st May 2019,https://gfp-coin.com,Japan,https://gfp-coin.com/pdf/whitepaper_en.pdf

We established stem cell treating hospital in Jeju, Korea and plan to expand it to Japan in 2019. Once LBXC holders can freely use these facilities at a reasonable price, more and more individual and institutes will find it interesting and valuable. Through Lux Bio program, we have teamed up with prominent medical doctors from a major plastic surgery group, REGEN, and our main focus lies on utilizing stem cell not only for anti-aging care but also 360-degree health care programs.

Platform,,turnple,,"TRP is aiming at the blockchain cryptocurrency which is accepted in the global market, starting from Europe, USA, Japan, China and Korea. The TRP will be used in real life as a hybrid TRP optimized for online payment and off-line payment by combining a fixed value blockchain pay and a blockchain with variable value. In the case of coins that introduced the concept of platform for the first time, due to the variability of mileage value and TRP value, uncertain transactions between consumers and merchants were made due to the change of coin price at the moment of purchase. For this reason, it's hinders the development of the platform and destroys the growth structure of the platform. By complementing these disadvantages, we have created a TRP that will be used throughout the financial market. If the TRP which was not suitable for payment due to the variability is exchanged with the TRP PAY, it can be used as a product purchase or service payment method with a fixed value. The TRP global platform will provide services around the world through our network of sports, real estate, entertainment, home shopping, medical services, leisure industry, luxury shop, culture service etc. The TRP is not an existing mileage or point concept, but an anonymity, security, and cost savings through the combination of blocked pay and blocked coins and it will become a financial coin when used as a payment method. Because there is no fee, on/offline merchants and consumers can save on commission costs. TRP will lead to more various forms of affiliate partnership services in on/off line bank payment, QR code, bar code, PG service and card service.",TRP,13th Jun 2019,18th Jun 2019,http://www.turnple.net,null,https://trpcoin.com/img_up/shop_pds/turnple/design/pdf/trpebusdup.pdf
