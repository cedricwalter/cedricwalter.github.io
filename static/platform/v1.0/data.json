Unlike practically\nall Proof-of-Stake protocols, Aerum’s ATMOS protocol does not introduce\nminting of new tokens to generate financial incentive to stake tokens to secure\nthe network. Hence, XRM will have a tendency to hold its value naturally and\nappreciate as network adoption grows. Holders of XRM token, instead, will\ngenerate an income in Aero coin by staking tokens with Aerum Delegates to\nsupport decentralized governance model, secure the network and participate in\na block minting reward and a fee distribution.",

It has been the first decentralized cryptocurrency to be created, and now is the one with the largest market capitalization. The platform relies on a public blockchain to record the complete history of currency transactions. The nodes of the Bitcoin network use a consensus algorithm based moderately hard “proofof-work” puzzles to establish how to append a new block of transactions to the  blockchain. Nodes work in competition to generate the next block of the chain. The first node that solves the puzzle earns a reward in Bitcoin. Although the main goal of Bitcoin is to transfer currency, the immutability and openness of its blockchain have inspired the development of protocols that implement (limited forms of) smart contracts. Bitcoin features a non-Turing complete scripting language, which allows to specify under which conditions a transaction can be redeemed. The scripting language is quite limited, as it only features some basic arithmetic, logical, and crypto operations (e.g., hashing and verification of digital signatures). A further limitation to its expressiveness is the fact that only a small fraction of the nodes of the Bitcoin network can process transactions whose script is more complex than verifying a signature.",

      "description": "The design\nThere are no blocks in Byteball, and no block size issue.  Instead, every new transaction references one or more earlier ones (parents) by including and signing their hashes.  The links among transactions form a DAG (directed acyclic graph):\nBy including its parents, each new transaction also indirectly includes and confirms all parents of the parents, parents of the parents of the parents, and so on.  As more transactions are added after your transaction, the number of confirmations you receive grows like snowball, that’s why the name Byteball (our snowflakes are bytes of data). There is no PoW, no PoS, and no mining.  Instead, we have the DAG, which already establishes partial order between transactions, plus we add the main chain within the DAG:\nThe main chain (MC) allows to define total order between transactions: the transaction which gets included (directly or indirectly) earlier on the MC, is deemed earlier in the total order.  When there is a double-spend, the version of the transaction that comes earlier in the total order is deemed valid, all others are deemed void.\n- Deterministic finality\n- Assets and on-chain exchange\n- Private untraceable payments\n- Regulated assets\n- Spending conditions (AKA smart contracts) in an easy to understand declarative language https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic\u003d1617816.0\n- Multisig: a special case of spending conditions\n- On-chain oracles can post data (such as timestamps, exchange rates, weather, various events) directly to the database, then that data can be referenced from spending conditions\n- Private end-to-end encrypted messaging: used to convey private payment data, communicate in multisig scenarios, and chat with a merchant’s bot.\n- Attestation of real name, which is important for applications that require real-world identity, e.g. ICOs that require KYC.",

DFINITY is based on a unique consensus algorithm called Threshold Relay, leveraging the properties of the BLS Threshold Signature scheme. DFINITY’s consensus mechanism has four layers. The first layer provides registered and Sybil-resistant client identities. On the second layer is a decentralized random beacon.On the third layer is a blockchain that is driven by the random beacon through a probabilistic mechanism for leader ranking. On the fourth layer is a decentralized notary that provides timestamping and publication guarantees, and is ultimately responsible for near-instant finality.\n\nRegarding scaling-out, DFINITY use a combination of crypto technique and novel solutions such as Threshold Relay, Validation Towers, Validation Trees and USCIDs (Unique State Copy IDs) to scale out with miners. By applying those techniques and with an architecture that separates consensus, validation, and storage into separate layers, DFINITY can scale infinitely.",

It separates the immutability of blockchain technology from its associated currencies, making it easier and cheaper for businesses to store data on the blockchain. It uses cryptographic isolation, which provides for the storage of unalterable records in a secure environment.\n\nFactom is a blockchain for decentralized publication that can exist atop existing blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Factom enables secure storage of digital proofs for data provenance and integrity solutions without disclosing private data or requiring trusted intermediaries. It is an open-source data layer protocol built on top of Bitcoin. It also allows businesses and individuals to build applications on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain.\n\nFactom uses a distributed ledger architecture that allows related entries to be linked chronologically in a chain for more efficient storage and retrieval.  Entries can contain any kind of data, but are not intended for storing private data. Entry data is hashed before being written into an entry block, and the actual entry data is stored in distributed hash tables and shared peer-to-peer.\n\nEach directory block is secured in the Factom blockchain is then further secured by cryptographic anchor entries written into Bitcoin. Anchoring into other public blockchains allows for interoperability and third-party security.",

It has been developed to organize the Merkle Root of the Entry Blocks.\n\nThe reference to the entries of data is managed by the Entry Block Layer. It organizes the references to the Entries made. Entries are the raw data that is accepted by the protocol. It can be a private hash or a group of data provided by the user.\n\nFactom employs hash technology, a cryptographic function that converts the digital data into alphanumeric strings. These strings are in the form of digital fingerprints. Factom ensures the security of these hashes in three ways:\n\nProof of Existence: The protocol anchors a hash to the Bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes. This is the proof of existence method that records the location of all the data added.\n\nProof of Process: The manner and the process of the entry are also recorded. This eliminates the problem of double spending.\n\nProof of Audit: By anchoring the data to the blockchain network, Factom makes the data available for audit at any time. The Bitcoin network only stores financial data. Factom on the other hand, can store all the kinds of data.",

More specifically, 101 active delegates, each one elected by the stakeholders, have the authority to generate blocks. Stakeholders\ncan take part to the electoral process, by placing votes for delegates in their favour, or by becoming candidates themselves. Lisk supports the execution of Turing-complete smart contracts, written either in JavaScript or in Node.js. Unlike\nEthereum, determinism of executions is not ensured by the language: rather, programmers must take care of it, e.g. by not using functions like Math.random. Although Lisk has a main blockchain, each smart contract is executed on a\nseparated one. Users can deposit or withdraw currency from a contract to the main chain, while avoiding double spending. Contract owners can customise their blockchain before deploying their contracts, e.g. choosing which nodes can\nparticipate to the consensus mechanism",

For example, using the NXT currency as a payment system cannot be restricted, creating a marketplace listing cannot be denied, and, for developers, neither is creating advanced blockchain-based applications through the Nxt Application Program Interface (API). Nxt smart contracts are not Turing complete, but have used a Turing complete scripting layer to create template smart contracts. Users would select the most appropriate template and adjust the parameters to create their own smart contracts.

The optherium ecosystem utilizes a proprietary, private, multi-decentralized private blockchains networktm, which is multisecure technologytm and supports multiple currencies, using dynamic biometrictm verification and instant multi-signature transaction confirmations all on optherium ecosystem. this allows users to securely store their digital assets and execute instant currency conversions and confirmations at rates of more than 100,000 transactions per second. the platform is also able to provide know your customer (kyc) and key recovery service (krs) modules that are stored on the multi-decentralized private blockchains networktm. Optherium’s focus will be on financial transactions and the needs of the enterprise finance and e-commerce industries. The optherium ecosystem will also support any other value-based transactions that are possible on blockchain. These include those transactions involving digital assets, legal document streams with authentication, real estate transactions, and many more.\n\nVision\n\nOptherium labs is a member of the linux and hyperledger foundations and the crypto valley association. The company is building and developing a new standard of private blockchain solutions.  By using an ecosystem with a proprietary multi- decentralized private blockchains networktm technology and multisecuretm, dynamic biometricstm- based verifications, the company envisions creating a unique method for instant currency conversions and confirmations, resulting in a user’s ability to buy, sell, send, or pay instantly using digital assets worldwide . Additionally, the company has created an exceptionally secure environment for storage of highly sensitive information using its proprietary multi-decentralized private blockchains networktm technology.

Bitcoins can be transferred to the RSK sidechain where they become “SmartBitcoins” (1BTC \u003d 1SBTC). Conversely, they can also be transferred back into Bitcoins at any time.

      "description": "Tezos is a generic and self-amending crypto-ledger which can instantiate any blockchain based ledger. The operations of a regular blockchain are implemented as a purely functional module abstracted into a shell responsible for network operations.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, Cryptonote, etc. can all be represented within Tezos by implementing the proper interface to the network layer. Most importantly, Tezos supports meta upgrades: the protocols can evolve by amending their own code. To achieve this, Tezos begins with a seed protocol defining a procedure for stakeholders to approve amendments to the protocol, including amendments to the voting procedure itself. This is not unlike philosopher Peter Suber’s Nomic, a game built around a fully introspective set of rules.\n\nIn addition, Tezos’s seed protocol is based on a pure proof-of-stake system and supports Turing complete smart contracts. Its proof-of-stake approach is novel, because the validator pool grows organically with the growth of the network. It has therefore been called \"liquid\" proof-of-stake by some. Tezos is implemented in OCaml, a powerful functional programming language offering speed, an unambiguous syntax and semantics, and an ecosystem making Tezos a good candidate for formal proofs of correctness.",

      "description": "Viacoin (VIA) is a decentralised, open-source cryptocurrency forked from Bitcoin in July 2014. The project\u0027s primary goal is to create a blockchain protocol, called \"ClearingHouse\", which would allow the building of fully decentralized exchanges and issuing of new currencies, as well as asset tracking, betting, digital voting, reputation management and going as far as allowing to form the basis of fully decentralized marketplaces. According to the project\u0027s management, these kind of services (or \"sidechains\") often face resistance from core Bitcoin developers when attempting to buil them on top of Bitcoin\u0027s own blockchain - hence the reason for launching the new cryptocoin. Viacoin\u0027s launch was accompanied by much attention in the media - especially because of the coin\u0027s explosive price growth (VIA reached market capitalisation of US$1 million in just a few days of trading), but also because the project was joined by Peter Todd, a well-known and experienced Bitcoin developer.",

      "description": "Waves is built in Scala, rather than the C++ used for Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. Each account is generated from a mnemonic seed and a derived private key. Ordinary transaction fees are fixed at 0.001 WAVES, with a 0.003 WAVES fee for DEX transactions and a fixed 1 WAVES fee for token creation.\n\nAlgorithm\n\nWaves is a Leased Proof-of-Stake system. Nodes are rewarded by transaction fees, and additionally the Miners Reward Token (MRT), which is a temporary measure designed to increase mining participation until adoption increases to levels where nodes are independently profitable. Waves is non-inflationary, and there are no block rewards.\n\nWaves-NG is different to most blockchain consensus methods. Instead of selecting a miner retrospectively, who then generates a block containing pending transactions, Waves chooses a miner in advance and allows them to add new transactions to the next block as soon as they arrive. Transactions are therefore added to the blockchain as quickly as network latency allows, and blocks are confirmed in around 1 minute.\n\nCustom tokens\n\nWaves makes it extremely easy to create, distribute, transfer, trade and even destroy custom blockchain tokens. It takes less than 60 seconds and a fixed fee of 1 WAVES to issue a token, which can be reissuable or non-reissuable (i.e., inflationary or fixed supply), as required. Tokens have a unique id number, but tokens can have the same name to avoid squatting.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nNoting the problems that have occurred with Ethereum’s implementation of Turing complete smart contracts, Waves has started by implementing simple account controls such as balance freezing and multi-sig transactions. Turing-complete transactions will follow, but these will have fixed fees and the resources required to execute them will be known in advance, avoiding some of the potential attack vectors and edge cases that have affected Ethereum.\n\nDecentralized exchange\n\nWaves features a decentralised exchange (DEX), built into the client. All tokens on the Waves platform are automatically listed on DEX and can immediately be traded against any other token as soon as they are created.\n\nWaves DEX uses a combination of centralised Matcher nodes with blockchain settlement to allow highly secure and private trading, in real-time, without having to wait for the next block for orders to execute.",
