Waves,Accessible Blockchain Ecosystem for a Token Economy,"Waves is built in Scala, rather than the C++ used for Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. Each account is generated from a mnemonic seed and a derived private key. Ordinary transaction fees are fixed at 0.001 WAVES, with a 0.003 WAVES fee for DEX transactions and a fixed 1 WAVES fee for token creation.

Algorithm

Waves is a Leased Proof-of-Stake system. Nodes are rewarded by transaction fees, and additionally the Miners Reward Token (MRT), which is a temporary measure designed to increase mining participation until adoption increases to levels where nodes are independently profitable. Waves is non-inflationary, and there are no block rewards.

Waves-NG is different to most blockchain consensus methods. Instead of selecting a miner retrospectively, who then generates a block containing pending transactions, Waves chooses a miner in advance and allows them to add new transactions to the next block as soon as they arrive. Transactions are therefore added to the blockchain as quickly as network latency allows, and blocks are confirmed in around 1 minute.

Custom tokens

Waves makes it extremely easy to create, distribute, transfer, trade and even destroy custom blockchain tokens. It takes less than 60 seconds and a fixed fee of 1 WAVES to issue a token, which can be reissuable or non-reissuable (i.e., inflationary or fixed supply), as required. Tokens have a unique id number, but tokens can have the same name to avoid squatting.

Smart contracts

Noting the problems that have occurred with Ethereum’s implementation of Turing complete smart contracts, Waves has started by implementing simple account controls such as balance freezing and multi-sig transactions. Turing-complete transactions will follow, but these will have fixed fees and the resources required to execute them will be known in advance, avoiding some of the potential attack vectors and edge cases that have affected Ethereum.

Decentralized exchange

Waves features a decentralised exchange (DEX), built into the client. All tokens on the Waves platform are automatically listed on DEX and can immediately be traded against any other token as soon as they are created.

Waves DEX uses a combination of centralised Matcher nodes with blockchain settlement to allow highly secure and private trading, in real-time, without having to wait for the next block for orders to execute.",waves.svg,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Scala,Ride,LPoS,,TRUE,2016,,,,https://wavesplatform.com,https://wavesplatform.com/files/images/whitepaper_v0.pdf,,TRUE,,Public,

Lisk is the first decentralized application solution written entirely in Node.js. This opens up the Lisk ecosystem to thousands of current developers with no additional skills necessary. Any web developer who is already familiar with JavaScript and Node.js can immediately jump in and begin building decentralized applications from day one.

By utilizing the Lisk ecosystem, developers can quickly deploy their JavaScript apps to Lisk Hosting & Storage Nodes, gain listing in the Lisk Dapp Store, and have immediate access to Lisk Compute Nodes for execution of the code. All while being backed by the integrity and security of the Lisk sidechain consensus functionality.

To top it all off, all of these cloud functions are run by the users and Lisk delegates who are paid through a built in invoice system (or by the network itself in the case of delegates) and paid in LISK (Lisk’s own cryptocurrency) or BTC.

State Channels
Smart contracts exist only inside off chain state channels. Just in case of disagreement the smart contract code gets enforced by the æternity blockchain.
Decentralized Oracles
An oracle machine connects public real world data with smart contracts. Oracles are categorically more powerful than Turing-complete computational models.
Consensus

Unique Governance
æternity implements a form of futarchy, where miners vote and value-holders bet to make decisions together.
Privacy
For many business applications it's crucial to have their transactions not recorded in public. Smart contracts touch the blockchain only in case of disagreement, acting like a self-arbitrating crypto court.
Security
State-of-the-art cryptographic datastructures and unparalleled decentralization provide efficiency and eliminate every single-point-of-failure.
Low cost

Most importantly, Tezos supports meta upgrades: the protocols can evolve by amending their own code. To achieve this, Tezos begins with a seed protocol defining a procedure for stakeholders to approve amendments to the protocol, including amendments to the voting procedure itself. This is not unlike philosopher Peter Suber’s Nomic, a game built around a fully introspective set of rules.

In addition, Tezos’s seed protocol is based on a pure proof-of-stake system and supports Turing complete smart contracts. Its proof-of-stake approach is novel, because the validator pool grows organically with the growth of the network. It has therefore been called ""liquid"" proof-of-stake by some.

ByteBall,A cryptocurrency platform ready for real world adoption,"The design
There are no blocks in Byteball, and no block size issue.  Instead, every new transaction references one or more earlier ones (parents) by including and signing their hashes.  The links among transactions form a DAG (directed acyclic graph):
By including its parents, each new transaction also indirectly includes and confirms all parents of the parents, parents of the parents of the parents, and so on.  As more transactions are added after your transaction, the number of confirmations you receive grows like snowball, that’s why the name Byteball (our snowflakes are bytes of data). There is no PoW, no PoS, and no mining.  Instead, we have the DAG, which already establishes partial order between transactions, plus we add the main chain within the DAG:
The main chain (MC) allows to define total order between transactions: the transaction which gets included (directly or indirectly) earlier on the MC, is deemed earlier in the total order.  When there is a double-spend, the version of the transaction that comes earlier in the total order is deemed valid, all others are deemed void.
