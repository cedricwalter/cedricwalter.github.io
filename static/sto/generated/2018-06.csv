UK,,ax1,1.0,"The concept of AX1 is to give token holders the chance to profit from the mining of various cryptocurrencies without the need for any technical knowledge. AX1 token holders are effectively buying a stake in a centralised mining pool, managed from a state-of-the-art data centre. With AX1, we are offering token holders the chance to participate in a managed mining operation and enjoy capital appreciation via contractually guaranteed economic rights in the portfolio of mined coins. After deduction of any costs and liabilities incurred by the issuer, at least fifty percent of the value of the mined coins will be placed in a segregated account in order to asset back the AX1 Tokens. Under this arrangement, the Issuer will have NO further entitlement to withdraw, or otherwise use for any purpose of the issuer, ANY of the assets of this segregated account: its value therefore provides a solid basis for the perpetual asset-backing of the AX1 token and peace of mind to AX1 token holders that the Tokens are a true and verifiable store of value. The assets held in the segregated account, though off limits to the Issuer will not just languish, however, but continue to be advised upon by the Investment Advisory committee and therefore could be deployed in Proof of Stake activities and or by being traded as part of exchange operations to the increased value of the token holders. The segregated account will even be audited on a quarterly basis to provide yet more confidence to token holders with the results posted onto our online portal for review.",AX1,16th Apr 2018,11th Jun 2018,https://ax1.io?utm_source=ico.tokens-economy.com,UK,
