USA,,minthealth,0.150738,"MintHealth is a global, decentralized health platform that aligns healthcare stakeholders around the shared goal of patient empowerment and improved clinical outcomes, at lower costs. To achieve these goals, MintHealth is introducing two tokens on the Ethereum blockchain: Vidamints and the MintHealth Security Token. With 40-56M annual deaths, globally, from chronic conditions, MintHealth set out to solve a simple problem: patient data is fragmented and spread across multiple data silos, making them unavailable to educate and empower patients to be more proactive about their own health. This means patients are relegated to passive rather than proactive rolls in their own health care, leading to rising healthcare costs, poor medical outcomes, and immense poverty in the developed world.",MHST,20th Apr 2018,10th Sep 2018,https://www.minthealth.io/?utm_source=ico.tokens-economy.com,USA,
