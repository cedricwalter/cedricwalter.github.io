Cryptocurrency,,krypti.io,,"Our goal is to bring stability to the market with KryptiWallet. KryptiWallet provides transaction security superior to any existing wallet through the use of patented Eclypses MicroTokenExchange™ (MTE) technology. It also takes data security to a new level by storing data inside the PCI DSS Level 1, HIPAA certified Eclypses Digital Vault, ensuring that users and exchanges who use KryptiWallet are impervious to the numerous hacks and cryptocurrency thefts prevalent in today’s ecosystem. Not only does KryptiWallet provide superior security than other wallets, it is intuitive to use. Usability is one of the biggest drawbacks for protecting blockchain data of any type; the more secure a storage method is, the more cumbersome it can be to use. Many hardware based wallets require a high degree of technical aptitude and are very time consuming to use, preventing widespread adoption and use. KryptiWallet has a simple, elegant interface that is intuitive and for all users of any technical level.",KRY,27th Aug 2018,18th Mar 2019,https://www.krypti.io?utm_source=ico.tokens-economy.com,Cayman Islands,

Banking,,br11,,"BR11 is a Security Token legally backed by equity in 11 high-growth revenue generating startups. BR11 is one of the first security tokens in the market and probably the first to be a tokenized VC fund with a pre-selected portfolio of 11 companies. Unlike 98% of the ICOs, which are pre-operational with no revenue, 90% of these companies already have fully-ready products, product-market fit, are generating revenue and growing fast. BR11 opens an investment opportunity to a much broader audience that otherwise would not be able to invest in a traditional venture capital fund, specially in Latin American assets. The 11 BR11 companies were handpicked from a portfolio of over 450 startups, all of which have received investments from either Bossa Nova, Brazil’s largest pre-seed investor by number of active investments, and/or ACE, Latin America's best performing startup accelerator. The token is legally bond to the company in Cayman that holds the equity in each startup, therefore providing a much lower risk to Tokenholders if compared to conventional ICOs that are not linked to any underlying assets. BR11 is a tokenized venture capital fund without a lockdown period. Unlike traditional VC funds that demand investors to be locked for years, BR11 token-holders will be able to trade their tokens in the secondary market from the first days after token issuance. All this characteristics offers crypto investors an opportunity to diversify their investments in real high-growth potential assets with a legally reliability unseen in Utility Tokens and/or conventional ICOs. We believe that we have the best from both worlds: the opportunities of the VC market and the global access & liquidity of the crypto markets.",BR11,21st Nov 2018,1st Dec 2018,https://br11.io?utm_source=ico.tokens-economy.com,Cayman Islands,
