Artificial Intelligence,,alchemy,46.62,"Debt financing has traditionally been facilitated by conventional banks for the past few centuries. Recently peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms such as Lending Tree and Lending Club disrupted the industry as consumers sought alternative financing channels. The P2P "Revolution" was proliferated in the wake of the 2008 economic financial crisis and was further popularized as these platforms offered cheaper and more accessible access to financing. Alchemy believes the P2P lending industry is ripe for another wave of disruption with the incoming adoption of cryptographic technologies. We intend to become the leading P2P lending platform on blockchain technology.",AFI,27th Aug 2018,10th Sep 2018,https://alchemycoin.io/?utm_source=ico.tokens-economy.com,Hong Kong,
