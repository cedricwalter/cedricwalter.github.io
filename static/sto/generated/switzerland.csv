Banking,,mt pelerin,2.0,"At Mt Pelerin, we believe that an evolution of banking is long overdue. With the global enthusiasm for FinTech and the ever growing success of blockchain technologies, we now have all the right tools to make this evolution happen. We ambition to design a fully regulated and compliant bank on blockchain in Geneva, Switzerland. Our key concept is the tokenization of the entire balance sheet of the bank, making the use of smart contracts on any asset possible. Implemented around a modular and open platform, comprehensive banking services will be delivered as marketplaces where the trade of tokenized assets will be possible with unprecedented liquidity, transparency and efficiency. This will also let us heavily reduce operational costs compared to traditional banks, while radically democratizing the access to assets and investment opportunities. Being open to services from other financial institutions in order to bring more choice to our customers and a healthier competition, our marketplaces will be the bridge we have envisioned. Our business model is also designed to keep 100% of our clients’ current accounts in reserve, acting as a custodian bank, in a fully transparent manner. In this way, they will know that their assets are safe with us and not leveraged for our profit. Instead, revenue will be driven from value-adding and innovative services offered on our marketplaces.",MPS,30th Oct 2018,15th Dec 2018,https://www.mtpelerin.com?utm_source=ico.tokens-economy.com,Switzerland,
